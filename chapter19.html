                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In Hellas Basin, the sudden fall of Warsats draws Guardians into a clash between Zavala’s mistrust of Rasputin and Ana Bray’s conviction that the Warmind could be an ally. As Xol and Nokris awaken, we fight through Hive necromancy, confront Nokris, and bait the Worm God with a shard of the Traveler, only to be overwhelmed. With Rasputin’s Valkyrie weaponry, however, we turn the tide and destroy Xol, cementing the Warmind’s resurgence. In the aftermath, Rasputin expands his influence, Ana’s family ties to the Exo Stranger come to light, and whispers of Xol’s soul surviving in the Whisper of the Worm hint at darker trials yet to come, leading us toward the Reef.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> What happened next began with an unusual amount of Warsats falling in Hellas Basin. Mars was known to be the home to many of the Warmind's systems, but this activity was unusually focused. The Red Legion's propensity to scavenge such valuable technology meant that we quickly had to investigate the region.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were greeted with a transmission from another resurfacing legend: Anastasia Bray, the long-lost Guardian, the infamous Hunter of Twilight Gap. She had converged on this location in her quest for the core of the Warmind Rasputin. Whilst we had interfaced with trace segments of him before, this was his true core—the heart of his system—and she had found it just in the nick of time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We arrived as the ice was beginning to thaw, and as the forces of Xol and Nokris were beginning to return from their long slumber. Commander Zavala was quick to assert himself into the picture, given that he saw the Warmind as an imminent threat to humanity if it wasn't capable of being made into an asset. Ana Bray wasn't so convinced and believed that Rasputin could be an ally of his own volition—something that Rasputin quickly pounced upon the opportunity to prove by deploying weapons for us to use against the Hive, in particular, a javelin filled with Warmind energy known as the Valkyrie.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the time being, Zavala was still unconvinced, and so he continued to take command, focusing his efforts on drawing out the newly rising threat on Mars: the Worm God Xol. We would need to kill Xol, of course, and Zavala thought that we would be up to the task. After all, we had defeated the Taken King. We had killed gods of the Hive before. Surely this time it wouldn't be so different.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to do this, we would need to lure Xol out, and so we converged on the European Dead Zone to steal a small shard of the Traveler—a source of strong Light, enough to tempt Xol's hunger and bait the trap. But the trap would not be on our own terms. We would need to descend deep into the Martian tunnels in order to lure out Xol. There we faced Nokris's brood for the first time, and saw firsthand the power of Hive necromancy used against us to summon numerous dead Hive into battle as it raged on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fighting through them, we eventually reached a massive ritual chamber and faced off against Nokris for the first time. He was defeated, but he escaped his death thanks to Xol holding possession of his heart. It was not unlike an ascendant plane, although not in keeping with the logic of the sword.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we placed our bait in the center of the brood's hold, we tried to lure Xol out. The worm did make an appearance, but even here with all our Light, his power and darkness were overwhelming. After addressing us only briefly, we quickly realized he was too strong. We were buried in the snowy drifts beneath the Martian surface. Our Ghost was luckily able to fish us out, but the situation was beginning to evolve in a rather dramatic fashion. Xol was now making a beeline for Rasputin, and our plan had completely fallen apart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala caved and admitted that perhaps we would need the Warmind's assistance and its Valkyrie weapons to actually defeat the Worm God—just as Ana Bray had continuously pointed out. As we closed on Rasputin's core, we overloaded some of his systems in order to overcharge the Valkyrie with yet more power—an unfortunate but necessary step for what we were about to do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite Xol's gargantuan size and his great power, with our might and the Warmind's weaponry combined, we were able to overcome this great beast and saw it destroyed in the shadow of the Warmind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the aftermath of the battle, Rasputin made contact with us, telling us that he would be the guardian of the system of Xol and of humanity as he had once been, and that he would have no equal. In this moment, he began to launch an entirely new series of Warsats into the system, expanding his reach and sight to new avenues and new heights.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our further explorations of Mars would lead us to rediscover some of the Ikelos weapon project, and in particular, updated designs for the Sleeper Simulant that Rasputin had initially created for Guardians during the Taken War against Oryx. We also found our first hints as to the true identity of the Exo Stranger. After decoding several messages and sigils left behind, we discovered that the Exo Stranger was likely to be none other than Ana Bray's own sister, Elsie. Elsie's final message simply asked us to watch over Ana, and to be ready, knowing that soon we would meet again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was also one mysterious circumstance—whispers on Io that drew us to the Lost Oasis. Beneath, in dark catacombs, we would hear the words of Xol again, even though he had perished at our hands. From these whispers, a challenge was rendered. Down here in the dark, upon completing this challenge and proving our might within the Hive's own logic, we discovered the Whisper of the Worm—the last remnants of Xol's hungry soul, cleft into a weapon and made manifest in our hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Xol bound himself to the logic of the sword and to us so that he could not only survive, but feed greedily upon the killing blows we dealt to our foes. And there would be many foes awaiting us in the future. Far greater challenges awaited us on the horizon, and it would all begin in the Reef.
