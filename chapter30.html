                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the aftermath of Osiris’s betrayal, the Vanguard pursued him to the Reef, only to uncover a deeper deception: Osiris had been possessed by the Witch Queen, Savathûn, who had secretly influenced events for over a year from within his body. Captured by Queen Mara Sov, Savathûn struck a desperate bargain—Osiris’s life in exchange for freedom from her worm. As the Guardians aided Mara in restoring her scattered Techeun Coven to perform the ritual, Crow’s hidden past as Uldren Sov was revealed to him through Savathûn’s manipulation, driving him into shame and isolation. When the time came, the Awoken and Guardians fought back Xivu Arath’s invading forces to extract Savathûn’s worm, but the Witch Queen escaped, leaving Osiris comatose and the Vanguard vowing to hunt her down. What awaited them in her domain would forever redefine their understanding of Light and Darkness.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Osiris had been one of our most critical allies in the last few years. Even though he had lost his Light in the last year itself, he had been instrumental to the events that had recently transpired, and his influence meant it was difficult for us to immediately call him a traitor. Yet his actions spoke otherwise, and so we were forced to pursue him with the objective of bringing him to justice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lakshmi had opened the portal into the Vex network in his direction, and the entire city had been put at risk because of his choices. He needed to answer for what he had done. Along with Saint-14 and Crow, we converged on the Reef and discovered that it was once again in turmoil—even as Osiris had arrived. Something there was drawing the forces and the eye of Xivu Arath, something that was driving them mad. They were hunting in earnest, perhaps for Osiris.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Xivu had also seemingly taken control of the Taken themselves, who previously had been under Savathûn’s influence. The pieces were slowly starting to fall into place, but what had truly happened would only become clear in the moments that followed our discovery of Osiris’s location.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we found him, he was conversing with a long-lost figure—Queen Mara. She had been rescued by a new coven of Techeuns that Petra Venj had assembled at great political expense. Mara was speaking with Osiris, who was now seemingly filled with an unfamiliar guile.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we demanded that he surrender himself and that he would be shown mercy, the shadows crept in—and he began to transform. Before any foul darkness could truly seep in, Mara contained the entity that emerged from Osiris in a crystalline prison. The horror of what had happened became clear as day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris had been possessed by the Witch Queen, Savathûn. She was within him—puppeting his body, controlling his mind, making his every move. Ever since the death of his Ghost, he had been vulnerable. As he cowered and hid from the High Celebrant on the Moon, a new force had discovered him, crept in, and taken control of his now fragile mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn had been by our side for the last year in secret. She had helped us defeat Xivu Arath’s High Celebrant. She had aided us in forcing Caiatl’s hand into an armistice. She had shepherded Crow on his journey to becoming a Guardian alongside us. She had even worked to place the Eliksni within our walls to manipulate Lakshmi—removing her from the picture—and to engage the Vex to create the Endless Night.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, contained within her crystalline prison, Savathûn struck a deal with Mara Sov. Osiris would be released back to us, alive, only if we could find a way to release Savathûn from her worm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As part of their pact with the Worm Gods long ago, all Hive consumed these symbiotic worms. They were granted immortality by them, but it required a continual tithe of terrible violence, binding the Hive in eternal service to the darker forces behind the Worm Gods. Savathûn wanted to be freed of that tithe—the one that linked her to the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Begrudgingly, we were forced to accept. Saint-14 was outraged, of course, but he had little choice in the matter. This was the only way to get his partner back, and so he had to work alongside the Awoken to free the Witch of her worm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To separate Savathûn from her worm, Mara Sov would need her newly assembled Coven of Techeuns restored. They had recovered her from the Ascendant Plane, but in the process of returning to the Dreaming City, they had scattered themselves along the Ley Lines. Meanwhile, they were actively trying to hide from the forces of the Hive War God or needed to be purified and brought back into the fold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This required us to enter the Ascendant Plane and to light beacons that had led the Techeuns down the path to Mara. In doing so, we would free small portions of the Ascendant Plane from Xivu Arath’s influence and carve into it a new shape—a shape of safety the Techeuns might use to find their way home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recovering the new Techeun Coven would also help to strengthen the Awoken once more. These powerful figures, though from a newer generation of less experienced Techeuns, were still empowered with some of the most potent magics at the Awoken’s disposal. It was absolutely imperative that they all be brought home if possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crow’s return to the Reef was also a source of major disruption. He had still not been told the whole truth of his identity by the Vanguard. His reunion with his sister, Mara Sov, left nothing but questions. He felt as though he should know this person. She was clearly important—for more reasons than just her title—but he couldn’t place why.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara, for her part, saw the reality of what had happened. She certainly resented it. The Vanguard was keeping the truth of Crow’s identity from him, claiming it was for his own protection, for his own good. But the shadows of the man he had once been still clung to him like dust to a grave. It brought Mara considerable pain—and caused Petra Venj to put a knife to his throat on at least one occasion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crow did not understand why, but he was growing more and more resentful of the asymmetry of his situation. He wished to understand what he had done to cause so much anger and hatred. One day, his patience and his resolve faltered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn had promised that she could enlighten him as to his past actions. It isn’t known what power allowed her to do this, but she might have manipulated an ability of the Darkness known as Deepsight to feed Crow’s memories back to him. Whatever she did, Crow’s old memories from his life as Uldren Sov returned all at once. He remembered who he had been—and what he had done to his people, to the Guardians, to the City, to Cayde.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was too much for Crow to bear. He fled to his vessel and entered a period of isolation for some time, refusing to speak to anyone but his Ghost. The horrors he had committed, the pain he had inflicted—Crow now saw the evil that others had always seen in him, and he was ashamed. Deeply ashamed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the pain that Savathûn had inflicted, Mara invoked her power and silenced the Witch Queen in her prison. Until the moment Savathûn would be liberated from her worm, there would be no more words from this deceiver. But at that point, the damage had already been done.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara was not finished with us yet. We could still play our part in the coming ritual, and to do so, there were certain tools of the Awoken we could collect and make use of. With this in mind, Mara Sov set us on the path to a weapon that better explained her own connection to her resurrected brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The weapon was known as Ager’s Scepter—a powerful tool capable of carving paths within the Ascendant Plane to fulfill one’s desires. It had been intended for Uldren but was passed on to us. Mara told us the story behind this weapon—the story of Ager’s Scepter and Rega’s Crown, an analogy for herself and Uldren, herself and Crow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She explained that across the gulf of space and time, they were cosmically linked. Their hearts beat as one, and they could sense each other’s presence from far-off places. But the brother she had known—the brother she had once used as a tool at her discretion—was now gone. Now, she would have to rebuild her relationship with a new person, with Crow. She would have to prove that she could change, that she could show Crow the respect he was owed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After months of preparation, the time eventually came. Xivu Arath’s forces were clawing at the edge of Awoken territory, and it was finally time to extract Savathûn’s worm. The ritual would pit all of Xivu’s forces against the combined might of the Guardians and the Corsairs of the Reef.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We succeeded in drawing out Savathûn’s worm after defeating many of Xivu’s champions. But before she could be ended by Mara Sov, the Witch Queen escaped. True to her word, Osiris was left with us—technically unharmed—but he was locked in a deep coma. For months, he remained unresponsive, tossing and turning, fighting against the visions of the Witch Queen’s mind, trying to uncover and unmask what secrets within it he could.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With Osiris liberated and our ire toward Savathûn burning, our next task was simple: pursue the Witch Queen and take revenge. We also knew that now she was a weakened monarch. Without her worm, she was mortal. She would have only one life. If she died, it would all be over.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our pursuit became desperate. In time, we would follow her to the heart of her dominion—and though we expected to find a place of darkness there, what we discovered would change everything we thought we knew about Darkness and Light. Savathûn’s plans were in motion, and there was little we could do to stop them now.
