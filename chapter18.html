                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the wake of the Traveler’s return, Osiris uncovered a terrifying future within the Infinite Forest—one where the Vex reigned supreme under the mind Panoptes. With Sagira cast out and damaged, the Vanguard and Guardians worked alongside the Osirian cult to restore her and enter the Forest, where they battled through time-bending dangers, uncovered the origins of Panoptes, and ultimately destroyed it with Osiris’s aid. Their victory was bittersweet, for in searching the Forest they also traced the fate of the legendary Saint-14, discovering his fall and reforging his broken shotgun, the Perfect Paradox—a weapon linking past and future in impossible ways. Yet grief soon gave way to urgency, as the Traveler’s Light stirred ancient powers on Mars, calling the Guardians to face a new and looming threat.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> It had been barely a few months since the return of the Traveler, and already the system had gone through a vast series of changes. Unseen to us on Mercury, Osiris and his ghost, Sagira, were also experiencing strange happenings. In part, they saw how it was affecting the Vex, and what our futures might hold should the Vex be the ones to build them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, as they explored the simulations of the Infinite Forest, Osiris saw into a future that filled him with dread—a future where the Vex had finally won. It was then that Osiris was confronted by something else: Panoptes, the Vex mind responsible for discovering and creating the simulation in which the Vex were victorious. In a moment of desperation, Osiris flung Sagira through a portal out of the Infinite Forest. She was damaged by stray Goblin slap rifle fire, but her shell was discovered by the Vanguard and returned to the Last City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ikora ordered us to make contact with the Osirian cult on Mercury and attempt to explore the newly active gateway into the Infinite Forest. At first, we failed to enter it, encountering strange Vex from both the future and the past, indicating a huge influx of active units in the area. After we had saved Brother Vance and those who resided in the Lighthouse, Vance recommended that we attempt to find Osiris. He believed saving Sagira was likely one of the best ways to do so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the other cultists in the EDZ had the equipment required to reactivate Sagira. It was our only lead at the time, so we followed it. The cultists were unfortunately dead, but we found the equipment needed for Sagira to temporarily indwell within our own Ghost’s shell, allowing her to help us enter the Infinite Forest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was there that we first met Osiris—or rather, his Echoes. These were effectively perfect copies of Osiris, made in a strange shimmer of light. He had always been able to summon them, a strange quirk of his paracausal abilities, rooted in an unknown teaching that only he seemed to have mastered. The Echoes led us through the forest, showing us how Mercury was corrupted by the Vex back at the turn of the Golden Age, before finally leading us to the Dark Future, where the Vex were victorious.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, we saw Panoptes for the first time and had to quickly escape its grasp, which was capable of superseding our Light within the simulations of the Infinite Forest. Leaving the forest, it became clear that we needed to destroy this construct. Over our investigations, we learned that doing so would require locating a map of the Infinite Forest and discovering the original moment when Panoptes had been created within its simulations. With this information in hand, we would be able to track the Vex mind through the many pathways of the forest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We fought through Red Legion invaders trapped in a time loop, various Vex constructs, and a variety of other strange hazards, all to acquire this information. Eventually, we found what we were looking for. As we discovered the exact temporal coordinates for Panoptes, it appeared before us and abducted Sagira’s essence from our Ghost’s shell. We were promptly ejected from the Infinite Forest and could only return later with the aid of Ikora Ray, who used her remarkable power to smash through the Gateway’s defenses and allow us ingress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We quickly converged on the coordinates we had discovered, alongside Osiris’s Echoes and Osiris himself. Panoptes was destroyed by our combined might, and Sagira was released. The threat of Vex supremacy had been cut short.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After reuniting with his Ghost and his student, Osiris sought to return to the Infinite Forest to defend us against the Vex and to continue searching for Saint-14. We returned to the Lighthouse and made use of its Infinite Forge to craft several implements of war. None were more curious than the Perfect Paradox.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The discovery of this weapon was linked to a signal within the Infinite Forest that matched the signature of Saint-14’s Light. Converging on that point, we discovered that it was indeed his Light, though he was nowhere to be found. As it turned out, the Vex had created a singular mind over countless thousands of simulations, designed specifically to drain his Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We followed the path of Saint and discovered what seemed to be a memorial to the great Titan. He had slain thousands of Vex in his explorations of the forest, and they had expended significant resources to defeat him. On his body, we discovered the broken remnants of this shotgun. We reforged it in the Lighthouse’s Infinite Forge, but this led us to a moment where something seemingly impossible occurred.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Remarkably, Saint-14 had left a message for us with this weapon, stating that he remembered the moment when we gave it to him. Yet we had only ever been raised as Guardians within the last half of a decade. Saint-14 had received this weapon in the Early City Age—or perhaps the Late Dark Age. Regardless, we weren’t alive at that time, so it seemed impossible that we could have been the ones to give it to him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Still, we held onto the weapon, understanding that not only was it one of the finest crafted shotguns we had ever received, but also that with time travel and the Vex, certain possibilities might arise, even if they were technically impossible. This perfect paradox might yet come to pass. We might yet live to see ourselves present Saint-14 with this shotgun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We all mourned the loss of this great hero, but we would not have long to do so. Soon, we would need to descend upon Mars and face a rising new threat. The Traveler’s Light had awakened slumbering gods and begun to thaw the ice around Hellas Basin. Soon, Mars would once more become a battleground of old machines and ancient shadows.
