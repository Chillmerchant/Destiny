                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the wake of the Taken King’s fall, the Guardian is summoned by Lord Saladin to Felwinter Peak, uncovering a terrifying resurgence of SIVA—a Golden Age nanite plague now in the hands of the Fallen's Devil Splicers. As the Guardian battles through corrupted strongholds, reanimated Iron Lords, and towering siege engines, they unravel the truth of SIVA’s power and destroy its heart in a desperate strike against the Archon Prime, Aksis. Though hailed as a new Iron Lord in an era of triumph, the Guardian’s victory foreshadows a greater storm, as the Red Legion begins its march and the Light itself comes under threat.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Approximately a year after the defeat of the Taken King, Lord Saladin summoned us to the Cosmodrome—in particular, to an old snow-covered mountain with an abandoned fortress at its summit. Little did we know that this would be some of the holiest and most storied ground Guardians could set foot upon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We strode out onto the mountain and, for the first time, entered Felwinter Peak. The mountain was being raided by the House of Devils, and whilst Saladin was still trying to find out why, we were able to fend off the invaders. But we did discover something strange. It was Sepiks Prime—the same servitor that we had destroyed two years ago. But this time, it was different. It was changed. Covered in a strange red and black mechanical growth, like a plague of machines—like infections, like tumors. And somehow, any damage we were doing to Sepiks, it would regenerate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon reporting this to Saladin, he exclaimed with shock and demanded that we destroy the construct with all haste. Sepiks escaped in the end. And as we secured the Iron Temple with Saladin, the Hunter Shiro-4, and the Cryptarch Tyra Karn, our next objective would be to pursue Sepiks, who had retreated into a previously sealed-off section of the Cosmodrome.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we pursued the servitor, we saw the source of its infection: SIVA. The nanite technology that Rasputin had used to kill the Iron Lords all those years ago. The House of Devils had found it, and their Splicers had weaponized it, turning many of their soldiers into cyborgs. In the view of the Fallen, to become a machine is to become a god. And so, with SIVA, the Devil Splicers had discovered a source of divinity itself—a means by which apotheosis could be achieved. It also made them far deadlier than they already were.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pushing deeper into the Plaguelands, we discovered that the Devils had used SIVA in all sorts of ways—not only modifying themselves, but also their forces and any of the Cosmodrome's old defenses that were still inactive, which could be repaired using SIVA. These guns were powerful enough to threaten the City, and so, while they were active, incoming reinforcements could not be dispatched. We had to destroy them immediately.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst we succeeded in this task, it was starting to become clear that the Devils were a far deadlier threat than we had initially realized, and their grasp of SIVA was starting to accelerate. Saladin would bring us back to the Temple and would tell us of the Iron Lords' history with SIVA. This exchange revealed to us that the House of Devils had control of SIVA in a rudimentary sense—they did not fully have mastery over the nanites, for the moment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With that in mind, we tracked down the original source of SIVA thanks to the assistance of the Cryptarch Tyra Karn, and returned to the Golden Age labs of Clovis Bray in Freehold on Mars. After confirming that it was there, on Mars, that the Devils had learned how to control SIVA, we were able to discover a weakness in the mechanism used by the Devils to control the nanites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Returning to the Plaguelands, we had our objectives. Shiro had devised a means of temporarily halting the Devils' control over SIVA and shutting down their defenses for a few minutes. After we had sabotaged their systems, we descended beneath the main base of the Eliksni. The Splicers had built up an area into a massive fortress, and SIVA’s destabilization had caused it to start detonating.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless of the danger, the Splicers were undeterred, and so we descended past the Archon’s Forge, deep into Site 6, where the Iron Lords had met their end. This was the SIVA Replication Complex, and we had to destroy it for good this time. But in the deepest reaches of this place, there was a faint echo of Light. Falling from the infestation, we saw what had become of the Iron Lords, as the infested and bloated remains of Felwinter, Gheleon, and Jolder rose to fight against us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their Light was entangled with SIVA nanites, which now returned to the purpose Rasputin had given them so long ago—replicate, eliminate, immunize. We battled with the remnants of the Iron Lords and destroyed the SIVA nanites that infested them, freeing their Light and finally laying them to rest. Before we left, we recovered Jolder’s helmet and set Site 6 to self-destruct.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It isn’t known if all the SIVA within the Complex was truly destroyed. Inert SIVA may still be lying around the Cosmodrome to this day, but for the moment, the Devils were unable to make more of their own nanites to control. They would only have the stocks they had made thus far.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We returned Jolder’s helmet to Saladin, who felt a weight of so many years lifted from his shoulders. His friends had finally been set to rest. He proclaimed us to be the Young Wolf, the first of a new age of Iron Lords, and gifted us with a blade to represent our new title and station.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would go out into the Plaguelands and start to rid them of the infestation of the Splicers. We destroyed the rejuvenated version of Sepiks Prime and ended a Splicer priest called Kovik before he could merge SIVA with an entire brood of Hive. We reignited Radegast’s original purpose by using SIVA and the armor of the Iron Lords to create the tools of a better tomorrow. Namely, we used them to forge anew a more powerful iteration of the infamous Gjallarhorn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The hold of the House of Devils’ Splicers was weakening, but Shiro-4 picked up something distressing. An intercepted transmission from the House of Devils indicated that there was a secondary complex where the Devils had been storing the SIVA nanites they had gathered. From within, the leader of the Splicers was calling out to all other Fallen, encouraging them to gather in the so-called Perfection Complex, where they could be freed from their mortal bonds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this message, and the large buildup of the industrial base in the Plaguelands that the Eliksni had been working so hard to create, it was clear that soon, the Fallen would build up enough strength to threaten the Last City again. This was something the City was unlikely to survive. With the power of SIVA, the Fallen had something they could potentially use to strike back at the lesser Guardians, and there were not enough Legends within the Tower to hold back an assault of this strength.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So Shiro, seeing this plot unfold before him, ordered us to kill it in its crib. We engaged in a coordinated raid on the facility—a preemptive strike. We would take out the Splicers’ leadership before they could gather enough strength to actually threaten the City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We quickly infiltrated the facility and discovered the Splicers’ second-in-command, Vosik. His command over the SIVA was powerful, but rogue SIVA nanites had started to persist within the swarms, and the Guardians would weaponize these nanites, turning them on their masters, bringing Vosik down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We ascended through the old Russian Wall next and discovered a way to its summit. There, we saw proof of the Fallen’s intent and ambition: a powerful prototype siege engine powered by nuclear components. Such a mighty device would have been powerful enough to break down the walls of the Last City, and so we had to see to its destruction. After overcharging it, we saw to its doom by sending it tumbling down off the incomplete section of the Cosmodrome’s walls, where it crashed into the seas below.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we approached the Perfection Complex, the SIVA infestation was getting stronger, but the ragged Fallen kitbashing had started to give way. Smooth, angular nanite construction now filled these halls. The seat of the power of these Fallen Splicers was near.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we descended into the darkness of the Perfection Complex, we faced Aksis, the Archon Prime. He had not just combined himself with the machines—he had ascended into one. Leaving behind his biological self and truly achieving the Eliksni’s version of godhood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But this pretender was no match for the Light of Guardians, and there was little that could be done to stop us, even with the command of the SIVA itself. We brought down Aksis, and after thoroughly scouting the Perfection Complex, we recovered another relic of SIVA which could be reconstituted into a weapon that used the nanites as ammunition. We would call it Outbreak Prime. And whilst it was eventually contained by the Cryptarchy, for a brief time, we used it to sow chaos amongst the ranks of the Splicers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With our victory over Aksis and all other threats seemingly gone from the system, there was a brief period of peace. It was declared to be an Age of Triumph. It was declared to be a time for humanity to celebrate their Guardians and the successes they had accomplished.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But beneath this Age of Triumph, signs of what was to come could be seen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It started with the Fallen. They had begun doing something unheard of. They had begun shredding their banners and fleeing into the deeper wilds. The state of existence within which the City had lived—known as the Hundred Year Siege—would come to a brief end. There weren’t enough Eliksni assaulting the various walls for it to be considered a siege anymore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the Cabal Scout Legions began marshalling for reinforcements that we should have been preparing for ourselves. Our Age of Triumph was short-lived and would be brought crashing down by the arrival of a foe unlike any other. He understood our power, and he would seek to deprive us of it—so that we would be left defenseless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Red Legion was coming.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The call of the Dantalion Exodus VI had been answered, and at the head of the invasion fleet stood the principal instigator of the Midnight Coup, ruler of the Cabal Empire, and the first ever Dominus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Soon, we would face Ghaul.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And he would not have mercy for our Light.
