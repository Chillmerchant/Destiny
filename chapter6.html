                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>The Cabal, a warrior race from the planet Torobatl, built an empire through conquest, ruled by emperors like Calus, who overthrew traditional Cabal military and political structures in favor of decadence and hedonism. His reign ended in betrayal by conspirators led by Ghaul, forcing Calus into exile aboard the Leviathan. During his exile, Calus encountered the Witness and embraced its vision of universal doom, becoming its herald. Seeking revenge against those who betrayed him, he sent assassins, including his Shadows, after Ghaul and his daughter, Caiatl, but they failed. Meanwhile, Ghaul's forces, including scout legions and Psions, set their sights on the Sol system, following in the wake of the Traveler.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> While many civilizations throughout the universe were uplifted by the Traveler, there were some that made their own way into the stars without divine intervention or assistance from a greater being. One such people was found on the distant and rugged world of Torobatl. They were known as the Cabal, and their society was one ruled by might. In their earliest years, mighty warlords roamed their world, claiming the right to territory by conquest and combat. Even in the days when they would break out into the stars, the Cabal’s great warlords would still challenge each other for supremacy, following the rites of their old ways.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is perhaps unsurprising that one of the oldest legends of the Cabal concerns their first emperor, a mythical figure called Acrius. The Cabal once saw the sun and desired it for themselves, so they climbed a great mountain to claim it. But before they could reach the sun, a great beast stood in their way. Generations of mighty and worthy warriors clashed against the beast, scoring small and seemingly insignificant blows, until one day, Acrius came and struck the killing blow. He ascended to claim the sun and was crowned the first emperor of the Cabal. This legend shows their lack of subtlety as a people, but it has also been a literal pretext for conquest. The Cabal believe themselves to be righteous rulers in this universe, and they believe that it is so because they are mightier than their foes. The sun is theirs to claim because they are strong enough, and so they claim it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The legend of Acrius may not be true, but the emperors of the Cabal have been very real, and across their history, they laid claim to dozens of worlds. Some of these worlds were occupied by peoples that were folded into the Cabal empire. The Sindû, the Kaga-Clipse, the Arkborn, and the Psions all became client races of the Cabal of Torobatl, pushed into slavery and servitude of their Emperors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The history of the Cabal is long and full of conquests made by tyrants, but none of these despots and warlords have been more consequential than one who changed the fabric of their society so much that it led to his own downfall. His name was Emperor Calus, and while he was emperor, he was not truly powerful. At the start of his reign, he needed to upend institutions for his rule to truly flourish. As emperor, he served alongside other powerful bodies but governed much of Torobatl’s strength. The people were ruled by a senate, and their military by a Praetorate. The old military traditions of the Cabal were maintained, but Calus was different. He did not care for them. He was content with the idea of conquest, but he was not a martial Cabal. He sought song, beauty, and pleasure in all things, and the Praetorate and Senate stood in the way of this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So Calus created a populist revolution to overthrow them both, so that he might claim ultimate authority over his empire. Calus changed the Cabal people fundamentally when he rose to power. His populism saw the warlike ways of the Cabal relegated in favor of a bountiful and hedonistic culture. Even at his coronation, the nature of his rule was made clear. He had the desert sands of Torobatl cleansed to be pristine and white, with his army of minions removing every single offending stone or plant that might stand out, and his entire royal court was recreated in the sands of Torobatl’s deserts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More telling were the actions he took upon his coronation itself, as the one true ruler of the Cabal. In the splendor of his perfectly recreated royal court, Calus had the old consul of the Praetorate brought before him, stripped of rank, title, and even clothing. Calus castrated the Cabal consul and banished him into the wastelands of Torobatl, saying but a single word to him, “Run.” This exemplified the ruthlessness with which Calus governed his empire. He was benevolent and generous one moment, vengeful and petty the next. He treated the old Cabal ways with contempt and uplifted new celebrations of culture and decadence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But behind the new emperor’s opulence, there was a deep sadness. This sadness was born of a love he had lost. His original lover had left him in a time of great sorrow. Calus knew he had broken things between them, and despite loving her, their relationship had been damaged beyond repair due to his selfish actions. But there was one spark of that relationship that still remained, one remnant of his old flame that he clung to. Together, they had created an heir to the Cabal empire, and her name was Caiatl. As she grew in his new Cabal empire, she perhaps did not first comprehend the changes to her people’s proud ways, nor did she originally hate her father, though it would not take long for her to have good reason to do so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, her father doted on her as he had done before. He had given her some of the most revered gifts a Cabal could receive, but this time he surpassed himself. He gifted his daughter a war beast. In Cabal culture, these war beasts are like the most extreme example of a human owning and lovingly caring for a dog. They are venerated beyond exception and are some of the most prized companion animals a Cabal can have. Caiatl named her war beast Milos and loved it dearly beyond anything else in the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus saw Caiatl’s love for Milos and, in his inconceivable cruelty and jealousy, grew envious of the war beast. He believed she loved her war beast more than she loved him, so Calus had Milos killed. He could not stand the idea of his daughter loving even a pet more than him. This moment changed Caiatl and set her down a path that would determine the course of her life forever. She now held a burning hatred for her father that was so deep it would never be dislodged. And she was not alone in this sentiment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were many within Calus’s empire that harbored discontent towards him. Caiatl was but one of them. Others included the emperor’s old bodyguard, Lictor Shayotet; the Evocate-General and Primus of all his legions, Umun’arath; the freeborn Psion dreamer, Otzot; and the Master of Festivals, Moli Imoli. All of them harbored ill intent for the emperor. But it was under the leadership of two Cabal that these malcontent actors were aligned and turned into conspirators: the former consul whom Calus had banished into the desert, and his chosen champion—the rising gladiatorial leader who had emerged victorious in the fighting pits—Ghaul, the Ghost Primus of the Red Legion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These conspirators joined together and plotted to overthrow Calus, in a plot that would come to be known as the Midnight Coup. Each played their own part in his downfall, but it was Caiatl who sealed his fate. As the coup was being enacted, Calus fled to his throne room. He sought a relic of the emperors of old—a shard of bone taken from a wish dragon. The remains of these mythical creatures were believed to grant desires to those who held them. With the shard in hand, Calus hoped to maintain his hold on power, if only he wished for it. But when he arrived, Caiatl was already in the throne room. She held the shard of wish dragon bone in her hand, knowing it held her father’s salvation. Caiatl addressed him, saying, “Father, I will not be weak.” She crushed the bone in her gauntlet and with it, sealed Calus’s fate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was hurriedly escorted through the streets of the Cabal capital, his massive entourage in tow. All traces of the old emperor, except for those loyal to him, would be scrubbed from the imperial hierarchy. They were all forced to march aboard a Cabal vessel known as the Leviathan, and Calus was exiled. The navigation controls for this great vessel were sabotaged, and the emperor was left to drift into uncharted space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Torobatl, the consul and Ghaul seized power, marking a new era for the Cabal. The former Primus of the Red Legion was declared the first and only Dominus of the Cabal—an emperor and military dictator in one. His power over the empire was absolute. With the Primus of all legions, Umun'arath, and the heir apparent to the imperial throne, Caiatl, at his side, his authority went unchallenged.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Emperor Calus wallowed in pity and sorrow aboard the Leviathan. His cohort of scribes recorded that nothing could break him from his misery. No form of entertainment, no food, no pleasure could rouse him from his sorrow. The exact amount of time the emperor spent in this state is not recorded, but what eventually broke him from his stupor is. One day, as the Leviathan sailed through the uncharted void of space, it encountered strange interference. The nature of this interference was unknown at first, but based on our exploration of similar events and Calus’s own recollections, it is almost certain he encountered the Black Fleet—what he would come to know as the Black Edge—and he saw the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The pocket of astral disruption caused massive quakes throughout the Leviathan. Calus, in an environmental suit, stepped outside to examine the ship’s hull. It was here that he beheld the thing that would define him for the rest of his life. He saw the Witness. It told Calus that all things were meant to end, that the universe would end by its glorious design, and that he was meant to be its herald.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After 12 hours and numerous quakes, Calus returned inside with a look of mania in his eyes. He openly proclaimed the doom of the universe, and then, with a sigh of what seemed like relief, he welcomed it. As he said at the time, “When nothing matters, what’s left? Joy, comfort, freedom, the true freedom of pursuing pleasure for pleasure’s sake, because it pleases you, because you desire it. I knew this during my rule, and I’d forgotten it during my exile. I shall not forget it again.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, Calus returned to his hedonistic ways with renewed vigor and a new mission. He would follow the directions of the terrible voice and become its herald. At first, he also aimed to exact revenge against those who had wronged him. To this end, the Leviathan’s navigation systems were restored, and the vessel charted its way back to known space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus began to employ some of his deadliest servants in his quest for revenge: his Shadows. Across the many worlds that had been conquered by the emperor of the Cabal, he had found individuals of incredible martial skill. They were brought to Calus, adorned in glorious armor, embellished with gold and heraldry, and offered all their hearts desired in exchange for unending servitude. Calus sent his Shadows after the conspirators, successfully hunting down the Master of Ceremonies, his former bodyguard, and a favored tea merchant he once believed to have served Ghaul’s command staff.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These were but the first attempted assassinations. Upon Ghaul and Caiatl, there were many. For his daughter in particular, he sent Shadows armed with a specific weapon: a blade passed down from generation to generation, known as the Heartshadow. Forged from a rare metal called Enactine, this weapon could not be broken. It would always reform to its original shape if but a shard was exposed to psionic energy and the memory of its original form. The weapon was an heirloom passed through the women of Calus’s line, and he made sure Caiatl would eventually receive it one way or another.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His assassins attempted to take her life time and again, and each time, the mighty heir apparent shattered the blade. In this strange way, they kept in touch. Calus and Caiatl did not communicate directly, but each time a new assassin came wielding the blade, Caiatl shattered it. In these reflections of each other’s choices, they knew of each other’s continued existence. It was the only way to gauge each other’s strength and intent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Assassins were sent after Ghaul and the consul, but likewise, they failed. The new leader of the Cabal had set his sights on further horizons. Ghaul had remilitarized the culture of Torobatl and sent scout legions to the far reaches of Cabal space, each sent under a banner of war with a promise: without victory, they would be exiled and could not return home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ghaul’s forces charted their way through the universe and eventually found their way to Sol. Five scout legions and an elite group of Psion Flayers would one day land upon the shores of Sol’s planets. But, like the Vex, Hive, and Eliksni, it would take time. Before any of them arrived in Sol came omens of both prosperity and doom—a single event that would change the course of human history forever. And that event begins with the arrival of the Traveler.
