                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After years of silence, Eris Morn returns to Luna, drawn by a resurgence of Hive activity and the awakening of a dark power buried beneath the moon’s surface. Following her trail, Guardians uncover the pyramid of Nezarec—an ancient vessel of the Black Fleet that manifests their greatest fears as living nightmares. With Eris’s guidance, they forge Dreambane Armor to withstand the pyramid’s influence and confront the darkness within, where a mysterious artifact reveals a vision of the Witness and the first whispers of the cosmic struggle between Light and Dark. As the artifact’s power ripples outward, the Vex revive the Undying Mind, setting the stage for a new war and heralding the return of legends long thought lost to time.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Ever since the invasion of the Last City during the Red War, we had not actually seen or heard from Eris Morn. She had been in communication with Mara Sov and had made several excursions with her in an attempt to better understand the foe that was approaching. Fate has a funny way of being cyclical, and Eris would find herself returning to the place where she had been changed forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She returned to Luna, caught on the trail of this new shadow—a looming nightmare that we would soon have to confront. Our first realization of this threat came in the sudden resurgence of Hive activity on the Moon. Having now crushed Crota, Oryx, Xol, and Nokris, the renewed forces of the Last City descended upon Luna with confidence. We had slain great gods of the Hive, and the great disaster was a distant memory. Little did we know that the tragedy of that nightmarish past would soon, quite literally, come to revisit us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We made our way in the initial assault toward the new Great Fortress of the Hive, which had risen from the Moon’s surface, and then delved deeper into the pits below. Our Ghost detected strange readings as we faced the Hive, but it turned out that they weren’t truly Hive. They looked like them. They had the same bioenergetics as them. Yet they were like shadows—whispers, facsimiles. Foes that we had known well, and yet, they were not those foes. Something wasn’t right.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We soon started to see visions of strange, ghostly figures before us. They looked like Guardians—shadows tinted in a bloody and terrible hue. Something was not right, that much was clear, but we could not have guessed the true extent of what we were about to face.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The oppressive darkness enveloped us as we moved through a canyon that led into a great crevasse. Our Ghost began to say that they were feeling strange. And then, we saw it—the pyramid of Luna. A vessel of the Black Fleet. The same vessel that had once belonged to Nezarec, the final god of pain. The vessel that had been sent crashing into the Moon during the Collapse. And yet here it was: unblemished, untarnished, and newly awakened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we continued our approach, we were blocked by a defensive barrier of the pyramid—a force field that slowed our movements and prevented our passage. But these weren’t the only defenses that Nezarec’s pyramid had in place. In response to our unwelcome intrusion, the pyramid began to manifest remnants of some of our greatest fears.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A nightmare, swollen with malice, began to take shape in front of us, and we saw green fire and a terribly familiar blade. What appeared before us was Crota, the son of Oryx. But this was impossible. He was striding forth once more across the Moon that he had ravaged. And yet, he had died by our hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though it was clearly some false copy of the Hive god we had once known, we cut him down and extracted a strange and nightmarish essence. But as soon as the Light-Eater had fallen, he rose again—flanked by nightmares of Ghaul and Fikrul, the Fanatic. Some of our greatest foes manifested once more as nightmares sent to destroy us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This response from the pyramid would have overwhelmed us, but Eris Morn was there to assist. She pulled us out with the same Hive magics she had used long ago to save us in Crota’s throne world. She extracted us to an overlook that showed the pyramid in its full glory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris told us that, in order to understand what lay before us—this ancient enemy that had caused our Collapse—we would need to find a way inside. Doing this would be no small task. To bypass the pyramid’s defenses, we would first need to understand them. After a little observation of the local Hive, we discovered that they were unaffected by the nightmares. This immunity would be our key to bypassing the defenses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet, while that revelation was important, another came swiftly after. A nightmare of Omnigul passed through the camp. It would have destroyed Eris Morn were it not for the essence we had claimed from the false nightmare of Crota. It turned out that this essence was enough to defend her—and that was our next clue. A lucky moment, a lucky break, but a vital one. We learned that we could collect and purify the essences of the nightmares, transferring their power into special tokens—a set of armor that would ward us against the pyramid.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was known as the Dreambane Armor, and to complete it we would need to refine our understanding of the Hive’s protection against nightmares. We ventured to the apex of the Scarlet Keep and slew Crota’s first daughter, Hashladûn. On her person, she carried a tablet speaking of a strange object—an artifact known as a Cryptoglyph, whose powerful runes could be used to cast the Hive’s most potent spells.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After further investigation, we discovered that retrieving the Cryptoglyph would allow us to finally forge Dreambane Armor. We would at last be able to make use of any nightmare essences we had gathered, including those of Omnigul and Crota. Unfortunately, accessing the Cryptoglyph would be no small task. We would need to find it by venturing to the lowest point at the bottom of the Hellmouth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deep within its catacombs, we entered a cavern that left us in the shadow of the pyramid itself. The darkness in this place was so oppressive that our light felt like the last flickering of a dying sun—but still we pushed forward. We destroyed a second daughter of Crota, Besurith, and narrowly escaped with the Cryptoglyph in hand. The darkness was so suffocating this time that even Eris could not pull us out. We had to save ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After taking further essences from the nightmares of Taniks, Skolas, and Phogoth, we combined them with the earlier essences of Crota and Omnigul, and thus our Dreambane Armor was complete. We had our defense against the pyramid barrier.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We ventured deeper toward the pyramid, and as we fell further down the cliffs, we realized that we were able to pass by the barrier. But our Ghost still kept speaking in a strange manner—it was as though he was suffering, as though he wasn’t himself. As we made our way further down, we jumped to reach the next section of the cliff, and were suddenly ensnared by a strange gravitational power. It began to pull us slowly through the air toward an opening in the pyramid itself, and our possessed Ghost sounded drained of Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A new voice echoed through our Ghost now. It promised us violence, beauty, and truth. It said that all these things waited within the pyramid—and that there was no turning back. It welcomed us into the heart of darkness itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After facing more terrible nightmares of Ghaul, the Fanatic, and Crota, we reached the apex of the pyramid and saw the first of many veiled statues. The meaning of these statues is still unknown, but in great areas and concentrations of darkness, they can almost universally be found.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From above the statue, a strange orb floated down as we approached. The artifact lay before us, beckoning, and we reached out to touch it. For a moment, there was darkness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then, we were back in the Black Garden. The sky was filled with dozens of vessels of the Black Fleet, and a dark copy of ourselves approached. It promised us that soon, they would arrive—and that it was not our friend or our enemy, but rather our salvation. It is still not entirely clear, but to this day it is believed that this was our first known contact and communication with the entity we would come to know as the Witness—the perpetrator of the Collapse, the leader of the Black Fleet, the immortal and eternal enemy of the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we extracted from the pyramid, we quickly gave the artifact to Eris for study. It was unlike anything we had seen—and strangely unlike anything else we had encountered inside the pyramid. It radiated strange signals and pulsed with an unfamiliar, sickly light. Those signals began to pinpoint directions for us. The artifact resonated with a new signal whose origin would send us back to the first place where we had truly conquered darkness in any form. It would send us back to the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using a Vex gate discovered on the Moon, we ventured into that primordial place, where the Vex of the Sol Divisive still fought to bind themselves to a greater divinity—a power beyond their understanding. Using the same techniques as before, these Vex had somewhat successfully bound themselves to that power and achieved a form of apotheosis.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we followed the signal deeper, we moved toward its source. At first, we had assumed this was a great mesa—a stone structure at the heart of the Garden. Upon closer inspection, we saw that it was in fact the remnants of a great tree. There were no branches or trunk, only a burnt and withered stump. Eris would later discover that this was the remains of a Tree of Silver Wings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Who destroyed it and why remains a matter of great debate. But at the apex of what was left of the stump, beneath a lake of Radiolarian Vex fluid, we discovered another veiled statue. It was here that the artifact’s signal concluded. When we returned, having chased this signal through the Garden, it began to change again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris informed us that after this discovery, the artifact had communicated further. Though these communications were not visions, they were messages of a more complex nature—messages that seemed to come from a different creator. It was through these messages that we learned of the creation myth: of the Gardener and the Winnower, and how the balance of existence before time was undone by the Gardener’s choices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What part of this might be lies, and what part might be truth, is still unclear. But what does seem clear is that whoever wrote it is not the same as the one who made contact with us in the Garden through the artifact initially. One voice said, “We will arrive.” The other said, “I am majestic.” There are many mysteries in these communications from the artifact—some we may only understand should we venture into the heart of the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The artifact wasn’t the only thing that sprung to life. The Vex of the Sol Divisive were emboldened by recent events, and they began to flood the Moon from the Garden’s channels. They took the opportunity to resurrect the Undying Mind, which fled into many different timelines across the Garden, making copies of itself to guarantee its success. It could not be allowed to return the heart of the Black Garden to life, lest the whole of Light and creation be destroyed for good.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Facing this threat head-on would be Ikora Rey’s task. She worked to construct a device that could pull the copies of the Undying Mind from every timeline, allowing us to destroy it for good. With its destruction, Guardians changed the course of history irrevocably—and hastened the march of all things to come.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the destruction of the Undying Mind, looming shadows would encroach upon us once more. They would arrive sooner than we could have realized. But in opposition to these forces, old legends would also rise—and even time itself would not stop them from returning to us in our greatest hour of need.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was clear in this time that we were marshalling for war. Two sides of an eternal conflict were beginning to square up, and we needed reinforcements—the first of which would come from a place that spoke of paradoxes and the corridors of time itself.
