                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Oryx, the Taken King, arrived in Sol to avenge his son Crota, unleashing a devastating war that began with the destruction of the Awoken fleet at Saturn. As his corruption spread across the system, Guardians infiltrated his Dreadnaught, disrupted his forces, and eventually pursued him into his throne world. After overcoming his champions, daughters, and the monstrous Golgoroth, they confronted Oryx in a final battle of Light versus Darkness. Though he tried to escape death by Taking himself, the Guardians shattered his power and silenced his scream across the stars. Yet in doing so, they awakened deeper threats, signaling the Hive pantheon and setting in motion the rise of new enemies.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> It started with a presence. A movement of unknown vessels that were quickly identified by the Awoken. Crota's father had heard his cries, and despite the teachings of the sword logic, Oryx would seek revenge for the death of his son. He had brought his armada. He had brought his brood. Worst of all, he had brought his Dreadnaught.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was the Awoken who would encounter him first. Mara Sov marshaled her fleets and the many Ketches under her command. She met the king out in the edges of the system, under the rings of Saturn. The two monarchs did battle. As the fleets engaged, the combat at first seemed even—until Mara unleashed her Harbingers like she had done in the Reef Wars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These ancient, anomalous creatures brought with them the same devastating force of gravity that they had before, and Oryx's fleet was crushed between the debris of Saturn's rings. The Harbingers slammed into Oryx's Dreadnaught, leaving the rest of the Hive fleet in disarray.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the Dreadnaught still stood, unblemished.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now it was Oryx's turn to unleash his own force. Using the Dreadnaught's mighty weapon, Oryx projected his own throne world into real space. Mara's fleet was crushed. She was Taken. Her Techeuns were Taken. And as they attempted to flee into the Dreaming City, Oryx's corruption spread forth across the system and through the gap that they had tried to use to escape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oryx's echoes would spread out across the system and found their way into many places of power. They took Hezen Vex within the Vault of Glass. They took powerful covens of witches on Earth. There were fleeting steps made by these echoes into the resurfaced Black Garden, and they even ventured into the Dreaming City, where through one of his echoes, Oryx would speak to Riven of a Thousand Voices—the last known Ahamkara. After a brief bargain of sorts, the Wish Dragon herself was Taken as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, Oryx proclaimed his arrival in Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus ended the Battle of Saturn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus began the Taken War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would first learn of it when we saw massive Cabal fleet movements from the Skyburners' base on Phobos. We went to investigate and discovered that this was not the Cabal forces marshalling. It was an evacuation. It didn’t take long for us to discover the Taken for ourselves, and we barely escaped before being overrun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Vanguard quickly convened to analyze the threat, and thanks to Eris, they too would learn of Oryx. Being one for decisive action, Cayde had a plan—one which he immediately contacted us to enact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We went to one of Cayde's old stashes in Old Russia to recover ancient stealth drive technology stolen from Rasputin. Even here on Earth, the Taken were starting to make their appearances. It was here that we faced our first echo of the Taken King himself. After recovering the drive, we took it to Cayde, who installed it on Eris Morn's ship. Eris wouldn't fly the vessel herself. That honor would be ours to undertake.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the vessel was ideal for this mission. With the stealth drive installed, and with it still covered in Hive detritus, it stood the best chance of masking itself from Hive detection and getting us close enough to board Oryx's Dreadnaught, shut down his superweapon, and prepare a landing zone for Guardians to invade.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Which is exactly what we did, though we discovered that the stealth drive and Eris's ship weren't exactly going to make a return journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also realized that we weren't the only invaders, as the Cabal Skyburners had crashed one of their vessels, the Dantalion Exodus VI, into the Dreadnaught's hull as part of a general boarding action and response to Phobos. After we'd secured a landing zone, we had to go after Oryx—an idea that these Cabal had also had in mind. The Primus of the Skyburners was pushing deep into the Dreadnaught with his forces. Oryx put a stop to his throne-breaking ambitions by Taking him, and thus the Cabal forces were mostly shattered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was also here that we discovered the way deeper into Oryx's Dreadnaught—and also that it was blocked. It could only be accessed by certain Ascendant Hive. We were at a dead end, but Eris still had a plan. We didn’t need to actually be Ascendant Hive—we just had to pass as one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to accomplish this, we were going to have to go back to the place where we had defeated our first great Ascendant Hive. We would need to return to the places where we had killed Crota—both in his throne world and on the Moon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, we would need a shard of crystal that we had destroyed in the Chamber of Night. Upon reaching it, we had to fight off Baxx, the Gravekeeper—a powerful Ogre who was guarding this site. Given his failure to defend it, he was also Taken when he was starting to lose his battle with us. Oryx clearly had other plans for him in mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we recovered this shard of crystal, Oryx unleashed his Taken in an ambush, attempting to stamp us out for good. He nearly succeeded, but thanks to our swift exit, we were unharmed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also briefly raided one of Rasputin's bunkers to recover another copy of the stealth technology that Cayde had used, this time from an actual underground part of Rasputin's network. This was all being done for the next part of our infiltration.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crota's throne world was heavily guarded now, and a death ceremony was being hosted to send Crota's soul onto the next realm. From there, we would need to infiltrate the ceremony and steal some of Crota's essence, indwelling it within the crystal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oryx's two daughters were present. Ir Anûk and Ir Halak were praying at the site of their brother’s tomb, and when we started to steal the brother’s essence, the two reacted violently. The transgression of our Light here was quite the insult.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would have been snuffed out, but thankfully Eris Morn was able to help us escape, using some of the Hive’s own magic to pull us out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We now had all we needed to confront Oryx, and so we returned to the Dreadnaught and passed through into the sacred space where the Altar of Oryx could be found. There, we would find the Taken Primus and Baxx the Gravekeeper once again. They would be our final test before we faced Oryx himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before Oryx's altar, we found the Taken King—and in this place of darkness, we would fight and match our Light to his shadow. It was a hard-fought battle, but regardless of Oryx's millennia of conquest, our Light was stronger.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the moment of his defeat, he channeled his power and Took himself—cheating death and allowing him to pass back into the deepest parts of his throne world. All that remained of the Taken King was his sword, Willbreaker. From this sword, Eris took a shard and gave it to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It would take time and guidance from Lord Shaxx, as well as a large amount of purified Hadium alloy from the Dreadnaught, but eventually the shard of Willbreaker was purified and infused with our Light, allowing us to wield our own mighty blade.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the final moments of its creation, we would need to destroy Ecthar, the Blade of Oryx. This symbolic conquest reforged Oryx’s old blade from a thing of Darkness into a thing of Light. Armed with this new tool, we would prepare to conquer the rest of the Dreadnaught.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We defeated a potential successor to Oryx—a Darkblade known as Alak-Hul—in the Hanging Crypts. We prevented the Agonarch Coven from raising a great Taken abomination and unleashing it upon the system. We stopped a pair of Bond Brothers from destroying the Dreadnaught’s core—and half the system along with it—and we set our sights on Oryx’s Court.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this place, we destroyed many of his Ascendants, preventing them from tithing their strength to their king and weakening him further. Because make no mistake: Oryx was still alive. In his throne world, he lived on—and was more powerful still there than he had been in the physical world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before we entered that throne world, we would need to crush the Taken remnants out in the system. The Taken War was not yet won.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had to dislodge covens of Taken gathering on Earth before they could root deep within our home. We returned to the Vault of Glass, where the Taken infestation had forced the Vex into an unusual position. They had to return Praedyth to our timeline momentarily, so that he might guide us in and defeat the Taken infestation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Mars, the Taken were at risk of overrunning the now surfaced Black Garden, which had momentarily been dimensionally locked to Mars' surface after our destruction of the Black Garden’s heart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, we returned to the first place where we encountered the Taken—and on Phobos, we fought them there as well. They were strongest here, but we carved away the infection before it could truly threaten Sol any further.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With his minions scattered and his armies in chaos, Oryx was left weakened. All we had left to do was dethrone the King himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We assembled a fireteam and struck out into the heart of the Dreadnaught. Oryx was our target, but by passing into the Dreadnaught's heart, we would also need to face Oryx's remaining retainers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The King's Warpriest was engaged in ritual combat, and by killing this millennia-old destroyer, we were able to gain further ingress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But we took an unexpected forward path.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Venturing through a portal summoned after the Warpriest's defeat, we found ourselves in Golgoroth’s Cellar, where Oryx kept drafts of slowly corrupting Light for consumption—like fine vintages or artworks painted in suffering. Here we found and defeated Golgoroth, an Ogre corrupted with the power of the Hive and the Worm Gods—an Ogre who had been created to tithe violence to Oryx, to corrupt the Light within the Cellar, and to contain one of the Tablets of Ruin within its flesh.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After defeating this monster, we progressed further—and eventually, we ascended to the final overlook.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here we slew Oryx’s two daughters, the Deathsingers Ir Halak and Ir Anûk.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was no alternative for the Taken King but to face us. He would destroy us by right of the sword, or he would die trying. His power was all but certain here—titanic in form, Oryx attempted to crush us with all the might at his disposal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But by using the corrupted Light and detonating it, we were able to burn away Oryx’s Darkness and send the Taken King screaming back into the void.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As his final scream rang out across the stars—yet again, just as had been the case with his son—a terrible silence fell over the Ascendant Plane. It fell over the whole Dreadnaught. The whole of the system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And this time, nothing would answer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of creation could breathe a sigh of relief. We had defeated Oryx, the Taken King.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unknowingly, we had set further events in motion with this. We had sent signals to the rest of the Hive Pantheon and the rest of the Hive Swarms. The King was now dead. The Light had triumphed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oryx's sisters, and the Great Subjugator Rhulk—the first Disciple of the Witness—would take notice of our actions, though we would not see their plans unfold for many years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the death of the Taken King, we also had the chance to recover three strange artifacts: the Blade of Famine from the Warpriest, the Shroud of Ir Anûk from the daughter of Oryx, and the Taken King’s own ravenous heart. Alongside these, our investigations in the Dreadnaught had allowed us to recover the Calcified Fragments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When over fifty of them were fully assembled, these fragments gave us the knowledge of the first five Books of Sorrow—and led us on the path to the weapon that Oryx had conceived of long ago.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With his ravenous heart, his daughter's Shroud, and his Warpriest’s Blade, Eris Morn forged a weapon unlike any other. The remnants of Oryx’s soul and purpose made manifest:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The Touch of Malice.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this powerful weapon in hand, Guardians had begun to feel somewhat unstoppable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were more troubling events still unfolding. Having lost all their commanders, the remaining Cabal aboard the Dantalion Exodus VI were sending out a distress signal. We rushed to the heart of the carrier’s command deck to try and stop them—but it was already too late. A message had been sent out into deep space, and it was requesting reinforcements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The message receiver at the time was unknown to us, but we did know that it had been sent to the ruler of the Cabal Empire. That ruler would be Dominus Ghaul—the one who would arrive soon and change the system forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it would take a full year for him to marshal his forces and reach Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And before he did arrive, Guardians would have to face a new threat from an old enemy. The House of Devils were on the march—and this time, they had discovered a weapon that would change the fates of the system forever.
