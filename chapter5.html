                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>The Eliksni, once a thriving and noble people on their homeworld of Riis, were uplifted by the Traveler and lived in peace, sustained by the life-giving substance Ether. Their society, organized into Houses, revered machinery and the Great Machine (the Traveler). However, their golden age ended when the Witness's forces, including Oryx's Hive, attacked during an event known as the Whirlwind. The Traveler fled, leaving the Eliksni devastated. Many followed the Kell Akileuks on a desperate pursuit of the Traveler in an exodus called the Long Drift. Deprived of Ether, their society devolved into piracy and barbarism, with leaders hoarding resources and punishing the weak, leading to their eventual downfall as the scavenging Fallen.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> The Hive’s rampage across the universe would bring them into contact with many peoples and many worlds. Their swarms were vast, and as Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath had now split, they had all covered different ground. Oryx’s brood remained the most powerful arm, and their forces would find another world seeded by the Traveler. These were the people of Riis, the Eliksni, though humanity would one day come to know them first as the Fallen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sources from the Eliksni’s own history indicate that they held a small number of colonies throughout several celestial bodies. The heart of their civilization, the jewel of their small empire that spanned a few stars, was still set upon their home planet of Riis. They were a hardy but adaptable people. They would be sustained by a life-giving substance called Ether. The exact chemical makeup of this compound is unfamiliar and unclear, but it can be created by a Servitor from almost any remnant matter, meaning that the Eliksni would be able to live in almost any place so long as they had a Servitor. However, in the skies of their homeworld, Riis, this life-giving compound was everywhere. It filled the very air and turned the sky a delicate shade of pink. It allowed the Eliksni to grow to their true natural sizes—between 7 and 10 feet tall. They had six limbs, four arms instead of just two. They were dexterous and nimble, but they could also stand tall with noble intent and philosophy, back before calamity arrived at their shores.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Eliksni were, in many ways, a truly utopian people; one of the best examples of what the Traveler could do in the right circumstances. Their society was communal in nature, and its people were organized into noble Houses, known best not for their nationality but for their disciplines. For example, those that would one day be known as the House of Wolves were at that time gentle weavers, great artisans who would craft beautiful garments worn by all their people. When the Traveler arrived and exalted their civilization like the thousands it had uplifted before, the Eliksni entered a rapturous age of peace and expansion. Beneath Riis’s pink sky, the Eliksni grew to exalt the Traveler and all life-giving machines. They came to call it the Great Machine, and their study of its divine construction would lead to the rise of the so-called Splicers. While we would know them better as biohackers and bio-engineers, the principle concern of Splicers was the study of machinery itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Eliksni believed that within all machines, there was a spark of divine potential, and they believed that within that divine spark, life itself could also be seen in some different, more tangible form. Eventually, the Eliksni would see this belief morph into a worship of machinery itself, with them acting with great reverence to machines that they would construct later in their society—machines that they would need to keep them alive. Alas, even with the many noble houses, the Eliksni were doomed to suffer the same fate as all those blessed by the Traveler, for its bounty was followed by bitterness, and the Black Fleet in the service of the Witness would soon arrive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The exact details of the fall of the Eliksni Empire, and in particular, the fall of Riis, are not well known. Much like our own destruction, the event is known to the Eliksni by another name: the Whirlwind. When ruin came to their system, they were crushed beneath the advancing hordes of the Witness’s minions. Chief among these invaders would be the Hive. Oryx’s swarm had arrived. His forces brought with them the same doom that they had brought to a thousand worlds prior. To them, Riis was another set of unbelievers to be delivered onto the jaws of death in the name of the Sword Logic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Houses mustered a defense of their homeworld, believing that despite the darkness, fate might be on their side. But tragically, it was not. Eliksni legends tell of the moment when the defense of their world was lost. One of the great leaders who rallied them, Chelchis, the Kell of the House of Stone, stood before them all and cried, “Where is the Great Machine?” For it was at this moment that the course of history repeated itself once more, and the Traveler began to flee Riis, away from the forces of the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In that moment, seeing that it abandoned their people and that Riis was lost, many lost hope, many were scarred forever, and many would remember. For scribes like Variks, it represented the greatest tragedy his people had ever seen. For warriors like Aramis, it represented a betrayal so bitter and so evil that it would create hatred lasting for thousands of years. But for one amongst their number, it created a moment of determination that defined an entire people. Seeing that the Traveler, the Great Machine, had abandoned their people, and that Riis was lost, the Kell of the House that would one day be known as the House of Devils told his forces to break off from the engaging attackers. He ordered his ship to pursue the Traveler with all haste, and all Ketches under his command were to follow this order.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This Kell, who would one day claim the name Akileuks, abandoned all those Houses who could not make war, and in his pursuit of the Great Machine, many others followed him. Thousands of Eliksni on thousands of Ketches began the long exodus from Riis—chasing the Traveler, following Akileuks’s banner—an exodus that would come to be known as the Long Drift. Some Houses gathered in groups of Ketches, and some followed the trail of the Great Machine alone. But no matter what, it was a time of terrible hardship.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Having left their homeworld behind, the Eliksni had little of the life-giving substance known as Ether to consume. They needed to construct new machines to create Ether synthetically, and so the Servitors were created. They were made spherical in shape, perhaps to venerate the Traveler. While the Servitors could make Ether out of any abandoned matter that was discovered, the scarcity of resources in deep space led to the devolution of Eliksni society. The once-noble people became pirates, scavengers, and warlords. Barbaric practices became commonplace. There was not enough Ether to go around. Those few who could get enough were the leaders of the Houses because they were strong. They claimed the position of Kells, and those of religious inclinations communed with the Servitors. Thus, the triad of power within each House was born: the Kells, the Archons, and the Servitors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A new hierarchy had been born from the broken remains of the old. Where before, the Eliksni had grown tall, now the Kells would become monstrous in size as they consumed more than their fair share of Ether to remain stronger still. With their monstrous strength, there was less chance of them being challenged by rivals. For most, though, rationing would be their way of life. Those without sufficient Ether remained small, stunted, and weak. Worst of all, the punishments doled out by those that ruled became harsh to the point of being almost unspeakable. It is likely that, during the Long Drift, the barbaric practice of severing an Eliksni’s lower arms became a commonplace punishment for failure. This would be known as docking, and many who were docked were turned into Dregs or Wretches, the lowest rank of Eliksni society.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus it was that the Eliksni pursued the Traveler and became less of a people than their history would allow them to remember. The once-noble banners of their Houses would be cannibalized into symbols of dominance and declarations of territory. They would no longer be the utopian people that had grown up beneath the Great Machine. The damage to their society was so great that it would permeate through generations. There would be newborn Eliksni, but they would mostly be born in a time when few of them would remember the Whirlwind or Riis. They had no home to call their own—it would be nothing more than a passing legend, a dream.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It came to the point that when humanity named them “Fallen” as a common slur and reference to their status as a people abandoned by the Traveler, many among the Eliksni did not completely reject the notion. They were a lost people, a tragic diaspora of vessels and cultures and long-lived memories. But should the universe be so harsh, they could have been snuffed out in an instant. They would continue onwards, following the trail of the Traveler to the next system that it had blessed. That would take some time, and there were other civilizations that would make their way to our astral shores for reasons other than vengeance and reclamation. There were those that would come to our shores in the name of empire and conquest, and they too would be making moves, even though the Traveler and the Witness had never laid eyes on them.
