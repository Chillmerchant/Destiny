                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Savathûn’s forces returned unexpectedly above Mars, drawing the Vanguard and Cabal into a desperate race to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Pyramid relic. What began as a battle against her Hive soon became a revelation of cosmic betrayal—the discovery that Savathûn had not stolen the Light but had been chosen by the Traveler itself. As the Guardians unraveled her deceptions through Deepsight and relics of the Black Fleet, they restored her forgotten plan, setting the Witch Queen’s grand design into motion. Their pursuit culminated in a climactic battle where Savathûn was finally slain, only for the greater truth to emerge: the Witness was real, its disciples already stirring, and the war for the universe’s fate had only just begun.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> It would not take long for Savathûn's forces to re-emerge, but it was unexpected for them to re-emerge above Mars of all places—a planet that had only recently been stolen by the Witness. Now Mars was back, and with even the faintest word of its return reaching the Hidden's ears, many agents within that order under Ikora's command converged upon the Red Planet, Eris Morn amongst their number. It wouldn't take them long to discover something they couldn't easily explain. A mysterious relic of the Pyramids had been found on Mars. It was brimming with paracausal potential and the powers of darkness. As Ikora landed to investigate the relic, Caiatl's Cabal also arrived and began assembling artillery with lightning speed. But they weren't here to fight for whatever this Pyramid relic was. Their quarry quickly revealed itself—a massive Hive vessel, Savathûn's flagship, the Lure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were dispatched to Mars with all haste and discovered that the planet was covered in temporal anomalies. Walking through these strange rifts, we would get a glimpse into the Martian past. More pressingly, there was now a large force of Cabal we needed to bypass to reach Savathûn. We unfortunately had to dispatch them before we boarded the vessel. But when we did board it, something was clearly wrong. The Hive on this ship were surrounded by moths—moths filled with Light. In a certain sense, this wasn't so unusual. Moths generally do accompany the Hive and are found in places of death. But for them to be full of Light was strange. Normally, the Hive would exploit or devour Light. But for these living creatures to persist and seemingly shield the Hive themselves—it was strange. They were not things of darkness, clearly. And yet, they clung to the Hive in all of their evil. Something didn't make sense.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was only one true remnant of darkness within the vessel that we discovered—an artifact of the Black Fleet at the foot of a half-destroyed statue. We wouldn't know it at the time, but this half-destroyed statue was a statue of the first disciple of the Witness, Rhulk. And the artifact that we had retrieved from beneath it was supposed to be a gift for Savathûn, should she ever ascend to the rank of a disciple—a gift that now she would never receive, as we would soon discover. When we reached the heart of the vessel, we found a portal into Savathûn's Throne World and saw the Witch Queen retreating through. But we would make an even more distressing discovery as we approached. A Knight of remarkable strength and size emerged from the portal. Stranger still, there was a Ghost at his side. And when we felled him once, the Ghost resurrected him, and he began to use the powers of the Light just like a Titan would have.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be the first time in our history that we would face off against a Hive Guardian. And unfortunately, it would not be the last. We would have to become very accustomed to the practice of crushing the Hive Ghosts so that they could not resurrect their charges. But after this moment, our initial assumption was rather clear. For these terrible things to have happened, Savathûn must surely have found a way to steal the Light somehow. So we pursued her into her Throne World and discovered the extent of her use of the Light. Instead of being a terrible place of darkness like the Throne Worlds of Crota and Oryx, her throne was different. It was filled with Light. This place wasn't home to a typical Hive brood either. These were the Lucent Hive, Savathûn's own brood, that were also reflected in the Light's luminous sheen. They were using the Light as a weapon against us. Their Guardians were formidable. But so was Savathûn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Quickly, we caught up with her. And we thought we had momentarily defeated her, but of course, it was far too simple—merely a deceptive echo, which quickly subdued us and cast us out of the Throne World. We were left abandoned on the sands of Mars by the Relic. And so we returned to it, where Ikora was standing there, waiting for us. We reported our initial findings to Ikora and took the artifact we had discovered to the nearby Relic itself. It then began to react to us and granted us a new power of darkness, known as Deepsight. Using Deepsight, we were able to reveal the psychic echoes surrounding certain objects or people. This allowed us glimpses into their pasts and into their minds. It could also be used by the Relic to adjust weapons, rewriting them as if pulling them from another time or from a memory of something that they could have been.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A Relic of power such as this, combined with the artifact recovered from Savathûn's ship, could create something remarkable. And under the scrutiny of the Relic, the artifact changed. It created something new—a glaive: the Enigma. A weapon that had been intended for Savathûn. A weapon whose designs and specifications dated back to a culture that had been destroyed eons before the Hive or humanity. This was an original design of the Lubraeans, one that Rhulk had been fond of—one of the only legacies of his homeworld to have survived. With our new weapon in hand, Ikora instructed us to make further excursions into the Throne World. We had to discover how Savathûn had stolen the Light at all costs. And now we had a new power at our disposal with Deepsight. Maybe we could use it to understand more about what had happened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not long into our incursion, we encountered an unlikely ally—a defector of sorts. His name was Finch, and he was one of the Ghosts of the Lucent Hive who had decided not to resurrect his Guardian after a certain amount of time getting to know him. His Guardian just so happened to be a Hive Knight, whose body Finch could always be found loitering by. Finch made a quick diplomatic request for safety and cooperation to assure that he would survive. He would assist the Guardians in their investigation and do his best to understand how Savathûn had stolen the Light. Whilst our Ghost wasn't initially trusting of Finch, he more than proved himself as time progressed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He first informed us that if we wanted clues, we might want to start with Sagira's Ghost shell. Savathûn had stolen it when she abducted Osiris, and it was still in her possession, located in a temple somewhere within the Throne World. Currently, it represented one of our only clues as to how she had gone about her theft of the Light. It was at this point that we also discovered that the Scorn had entered the Throne World. Their presence here was an enigma, one seemingly unexplained. At first, we thought it might be Fikrul the Fanatic, commanding them to encounter and conquer new lands. But this wasn't the case.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finch quickly explained that with Savathûn's Light in the Throne World, there would need to be a more powerful overriding force of darkness to counter and control them. A counterbalancing force couldn't possibly be Fikrul. Savathûn's Light was simply too powerful. This was our first hint at the menace that we would later face—this and the looming Pyramid far off in the distance. When we discovered Sagira's shell, it was found in a ruined temple to Savathûn's sister, Xivu Arath, Hive God of War. When we grabbed it, we heard a brief psychic echo of Savathûn. It stated that she had stood before an ancient being with a thousand names. She would name one of them—the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was the first time our Guardians had heard of the ancient foe's identity—the ancient foe that had brought about our Collapse. The same foe that commanded the Black Fleet and that had reached out to tempt us with Stasis. We didn't know it at the time, but we had just unmasked Savathûn's greatest enemy and humanity's most ancient foe. But aside from this one psychic echo, the shell was inert, and we would need more clues to continue our investigation. But thanks to good sleuthing, we quickly discovered a new location deep in Savathûn's Throne World, hidden to all but the keenest of eyes—a place known as the Altar of Reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amplifying our powers of Deepsight here allowed us to tap into the psychic echoes of Sagira's shell more closely, and we heard more context from the words of Savathûn that had manifested around Sagira's shell. We learned that she had used Osiris's form to get close to us and learn more about the nature of the Light. It felt like our investigations were starting to bear fruit, and so we continued to search for more objects to interact with. Our Deepsight was now the key to our investigation. Leveraging its power of insight, we would be able to see what was going on with the past of any object that we recovered from the Throne World. Taking it to the Altar of Reflection allowed us to glimpse what had been and unveil more of Savathûn's plans.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eager to prove his worth, Finch quickly found another lead for us on an object that might help us discern Savathûn's plans—and it most certainly was a compelling lead. A temple dedicated to Oryx, guarded by Alak-Hul, the former Darkblade who had now been reborn in the Light, was supposedly housing an object of incredible power that Savathûn had stolen from Oryx's Dreadnaught. Unfortunately for the Guardian of this sanctuary, Alak-Hul, the long-awaited rematch between us and him ended much the same way as the first encounter did. And within the Lucent Temple of the Navigator, he was struck down once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As it turned out, the temple did indeed contain a powerful artifact from Oryx's past—a Tablet of Ruin. One of Oryx's ancient records in which he recorded the secrets he stole from Akka—the secret behind the power to Take. Returning the Tablet of Ruin to the Altar of Reflection showed us more of Oryx's power to Take. It told us that this power was the power to move things between dimensions and that the Witness also had this power. The psychic echo of Savathûn proclaimed her plan: that she would use this power not to Take, but to save. She would hide the Traveler away in her own Throne World and seal it away so that she could keep it safe—and keep it for herself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This meant that the urgency of the stakes was starting to become even more clear. We needed more leads. Finch made another educated guess. He stated that there might be another clue hidden in a third temple. This time, instead of being dedicated to one of Savathûn's siblings, this was a temple dedicated to Savathûn herself—or rather, her younger self, Sathona. We raided this temple and discovered a Worm Familiar on a statue that represented the younger version of the Witch Queen. As it turned out, this wasn't some effigy of a Worm Familiar—it was the original Worm Familiar.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The one that had been sent by Rhulk to the Osmium King. The one that had whispered to Savathûn and the Osmium King of a terrible calamity that would be written in the stars—of the God Wave. This was the thing that had whispered to Savathûn and convinced her and her sisters to go down into the Deep. This was the reason that the Hive existed—the original mover in a plan set in motion long ago. But this Worm was well guarded. We had to fight our way through an illusion of an Ahamkara, whose might was palpable, and whose strength and reinforcements were quickly descending upon us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Escaping from out of the Temple of the Cunning, we were able to make our way back to the Altar of Reflection. But this time, when we approached with the Worm, something barred our access to it immediately. We couldn't even enter the Altar. Our only lead had suddenly turned into a dead end. Ikora believed that she had grown tunnel-visioned in the investigation and took a moment to distance herself from the search thanks to growing pressure from Zavala. His belligerence certainly didn't help. He wasn't keen on the idea of us using Deepsight either, given that it was yet another illicit use of a power of darkness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This didn't stop him from fully accepting what Eris Morn said, though. As one of our foremost experts in the power of darkness, she was ready to assist us in our next steps. She had discovered something that would unstick our investigation. Deep in Savathûn's apothecary wing, one of her High Council Wizards held a shard of crystal. This crystal shard had been from the prison that Mara Sov had placed Savathûn into only half a year ago—the same prison that she had communed with us from, the same prison from which she had dislodged Uldren's memory into Crow's mind. We rushed to retrieve the shard, and despite fierce resistance, we were able to retrieve it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The forces there included Savathûn's right hand, one of her High Council Wizards, but even she was not enough to stop us. This time, as we brought the crystal shard to the Altar of Reflection, we were granted ingress, and a shocking truth was revealed to us. Through the use of our Deepsight, we saw the moment after Savathûn had been freed from her Worm. And we saw that she transported herself to a cliffside near the Last City. Breaking out of the prison had left her mortally wounded, and with no Worm, her immortality was gone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She pulled the shard of crystal from her side and knelt on the cliffside in the sight of the Traveler, speaking to it, espousing the possibility that it had been clever enough to deceive her and allow her to simply die. And then she did. We witnessed her final death. Clawing and beating at the edges of reality, she simply passed away. There was no climactic final battle. There was no death at the hands of a great warrior. She simply faded. And then a Ghost appeared—Immaru. He had found Savathûn's corpse. And as Ghosts do, he scanned it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More shocking still, he deemed her worthy of the Traveler's Light. To say that this newfound truth would shake us to our core is an understatement. Savathûn, as it turns out, had never stolen the Light—it had been willingly given to her by the Traveler. The Hive were some of the Traveler's most ancient enemies. They had committed countless atrocities against humanity and the Eliksni. They had persistently hunted the Traveler with the desire to consume its Light. And yet, one of the greatest foes the Traveler had ever known had been chosen and had been deemed worthy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As if this revelation wasn't shocking enough, Savathûn herself quickly made an appearance within the Altars of Reflection. She had been watching us the whole time and had gained a crucial insight thanks to our actions. It's worth remembering that Savathûn died and was reborn as a Guardian. Guardians have no memories of their past lives. But within Savathûn's Throne World, she has a unique degree of insight and can see all things that happen. With this in mind, Savathûn was able to watch our every single move within the Altar of Reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She didn't remember her plan. She had made it long ago in her past life. But now, we had fed that same plan back to her. She didn't need to remember it—we had remembered it for her. And suddenly, it was clear that this was all a trap laid for us by the Witch Queen all along. We were meant to follow her. We were meant to find the Relic of the Black Fleet within her ship. We were meant to bring it to the Relic and craft the Enigma, discovering Deepsight. We were meant to find Sagira's shell and the Tablet of Ruin and the crystal shard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were meant to feed Savathûn's plan back to her. And we had done exactly that. Now she knew exactly what she intended to do. She would abduct the Traveler, seal her Throne World, and cut us off from the Light for good. We were promptly ejected from the Altar of Reflection. We had failed. Savathûn had her plan in place now. It was only a matter of time. We had been pawns in it all along. But Ikora, in this moment, had some resolve. Despite the supposed treachery of the Traveler, she would go on and keep fighting for the people of the Last City—the ones she had sworn to protect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even if the Traveler had betrayed us, it didn't matter. We would still use the Light to defend humanity. That was our purpose, after all. And besides, there was one remaining lead in this investigation—the Worm Familiar. We had still not been able to read it via the Altars of Reflection, but the Altar wasn't the only way to access Deepsight. We had originally found it from the Relic on Mars. And so Ikora took the Familiar to the Relic and used darkness via Deepsight to discern the Worm's secrets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was here that she saw the truth—never told in the Books of Sorrow, or the World's Grave, or any ancient histories of the Hive. The Worm Familiar contained a psychic echo of the words of the Witness itself. It was speaking to its first disciple, Rhulk. And we heard the words of its plan exposed. It would tell the most cunning of the three siblings of a coming cataclysm. It would force them to go down into the Deep. It would force them to take the Pact of the Worms and to become the Hive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But there would be no God Wave. There would be no cataclysm. Savathûn might have been the God of Deception, but the Witness had lied to the Hive all along. This was a small piece of information relative to the coming calamity that Savathûn was about to bring, but it was crucial nonetheless. It was perhaps the only break in Savathûn's armor that we could find. There was little more we could do now. We simply had to return to Savathûn's Throne World and confront her once and for all.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And when we arrived, we saw that she had already begun her ritual. The Traveler had begun to manifest in the skies above the Throne World. If we didn't hurry, the Throne World would be sealed, and the Traveler would be stuck here forever. So we raced to the pinnacle of Savathûn's Throne World, bringing the Worm Familiar with us. When we entered Savathûn's ritual space and attempted to dislodge her progress, we realized that the altar at its center was Deepsight compatible. It could show Savathûn the truth of the deception played upon her by the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we placed the Worm Familiar upon it. The truth confused and then enraged the Witch Queen. It made her reckless. This weakness was just enough. It exposed the Witch Queen. Savathûn had always believed herself to be superior, but now she was rattled. At the apex of the Throne World, in a great battle of Light against Light, we fought with the Witch Queen Savathûn. And despite all the odds stacked against us—despite Savathûn's ancient and unknown powers, despite her having won in the battle of lies and deception—she fell.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were victorious. But in her moment of defeat, Savathûn warned us that we had only succeeded in leaving the Traveler vulnerable. She told us that the Witness was returning and that the game was ours to play now, win or lose. Before we could crush her Ghost, Immaru, a great beam of Light appeared from above. The Traveler had left and was returned to the Last City. And in this bright shining Light, Immaru disappeared as well. The Hidden would come to collect Savathûn's remains for study.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And we had a new objective. Savathûn had given us the final warning we needed. Our foe was unmasked—the Witness. We needed to learn more of it. We needed to prepare for it. We would need to face it and defeat it for ourselves. We weren't done in the Throne World either. We learned more of the Witness from Mara Sov, who intended to discover more about it via Savathûn's Worm. It had been there during the entirety of Savathûn's life and had witnessed the Collapse—those crucial moments where the Witness's forces had been defeated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As is seemingly tradition at this point, we would end up weaponizing this creature on our path to restoring it. And it would begrudgingly inform us that Savathûn had played a key role in preventing the Witness from completely destroying us in the Collapse. It wouldn't be some time before we learned what that effort was, but we did discover that it was Savathûn's actions—killing Nezarec and stealing the Veil—that prevented the Witness from enacting the Final Shape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the greatest mystery of the Throne World was one that was yet to reveal itself. There was a Pyramid far off in the distance. Its influence had begun to corrupt Savathûn's Throne World visibly. Whilst her core structures were still cast in a lucent sheen, the farther away from the heart of Savathûn's Throne World one ventured, the more it was visible that the Pyramid's corruption was seeping outward. Eventually, Savathûn's own structures fell into decay, and an entirely new kind of architecture arose—ancient Pyramid complexes, the architecture of the Black Fleet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was no coincidence. This was the vessel of the first disciple of the Witness, Rhulk. He had been cursed by Savathûn when she had taken the Light, but even though the curse had sunken Rhulk's Pyramid vessel into the bog, it couldn't prevent Rhulk from exercising his power. He was still sending out his forces, namely the Scorn we had encountered throughout our journey, into Savathûn's Throne World proper. Her forces were losing a ground war against his, and we still didn't know of his existence until we investigated the Pyramid for ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That was where we first heard the words of the first disciple of the Witness. He saw our power and had seen that we had defeated the Witch Queen, and so he invited us into his Pyramid—to either accept the gifts of the Witness or fall as its enemies to be subjugated, to rise from the Deep or drown within it. We pursued the first disciple of the Witness into the heart of his own vessel, and at each turn, we were offered power, but we spurned it. We destroyed his caretaker, undid his dark offerings, and traipsed through his many vessels that he had collected from Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, despite our efforts, Rhulk had seen the supposed measure of our power and deemed us unfit to join the Witness. We had been the Defiant, and as was seemingly tradition in Rhulk's eyes, there was nothing more for us to be except crushed. To this end, he deployed his ultimate weapon—the Upended, a superweapon powered by the mother of the Worm Gods, Xita, who still lay within Rhulk's Pyramid as his captive. The exact function of this weapon was unknown, but it could supposedly turn worlds upside down and was powerful enough to seal Savathûn's Throne World from the Light, rendering us helpless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we sped on to confront the disciple and pushed to destroy him with all haste. Rhulk was by far the most powerful being we had faced up until this point. His power eclipsed both that of Oryx and Savathûn; his command of darkness was unyielding. But Rhulk had one weakness—arrogance. He strode across the battlefield not as a great destroyer and conqueror but as one who was watching, seeing us claw our way toward victory as entertainment. He underestimated us, and his hubris would be his undoing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By our combined powers of Light and Dark, by the time we had dealt the mortal blow, Rhulk realized it was too late. His last words, faithful even in his dying breath, were a plea to the Witness for forgiveness. And thus the first disciple fell. Thus did we prove that the Witness's forces were not unassailable and that they would not conquer us so easily. We had dealt the first serious blow to our enemies. It would not be the last. The war had just begun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But back on Earth, we had other issues to deal with. Savathûn might have been defeated, but her forces and her brood were running rampant across the system and were harvesting the Light from the Last City's Guardians—fledgling Guardians in particular, who were not powerful enough to fend off these newcomers of equal station. We first learned of this thanks to a rather confrontational conversation in the Tower Hangar, one between Lord Saladin and Caiatl.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our earlier actions on Mars, at the very beginning of the conflict, involved us killing some of her advanced forces. They had fired upon us first, and so Caiatl agreed to forgive the transgression but once. This would be something she would never repeat, true to her word. Zavala seized upon this moment of diplomacy and proposed a joint action of sorts—an allied strike against the enemy of Caiatl's enemy, against the Hive Guardians. Using her Psion forces, Caiatl would help us to secure Hive Guardians within a mindscape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would then enter their own psyches and render them effectively brain-dead by destroying their inner selves. In this state, their minds could be scrubbed for intelligence by the Psions, and their plans could eventually be deduced. Crow immediately took issue with the plan, believing that it wasn't right to put even monsters through such torment. He had once been seen by everyone as a monster, and he saw that the way we treated our enemies had an important impact on the way that we treated each other as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Saladin would temper his beliefs by saying that whilst mercy was important, mercy for one's foes shouldn't come at the cost of mercy to one's allies. But at the time, Crow didn't listen. Rejecting this wisdom would have grave consequences. Eventually, we discovered what the Hive's plan was. They were gathering Light above the Scarlet Keep and were intending to use the Keep as an amplifier for a ritual. This ritual would have manifested Savathûn's Throne World above Earth, on the Moon. This would have allowed them to engage in a direct assault on Earth and would have let them take the Traveler if we did not stop them immediately.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Together with Caiatl's forces, we confronted these Hive and destroyed their commander before they could finish the ritual. Crow had been unresponsive during this operation, and the reason why would soon hit us like a ton of bricks. When nobody was watching, Crow had returned to the command carrier that the Vanguard was using, parked within the Last City—the H.E.L.M. It was here that one of Caiatl's Psion optices was scrubbing through the minds of the various captured Hive. In this moment, Crow followed his convictions and did what he believed was right, disconnecting the Psion from the captured Hive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would allow the Hive to finally rest as they were no longer in a state of limbo. But unfortunately, in doing so, the Psion who was connected to the Hive was also killed. Crow lamented his error, but Saladin quickly arrived on the scene and chastised him for his foolishness. Caiatl would not so easily forgive this mistake. We had already been offered mercy once for our own transgressions. Crow would need to face the consequences of his actions with Cabal justice in mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When Crow confessed his error to Caiatl, she demanded that he take responsibility. A life for a life was her way, and Crow's life would be forfeit for his actions. But Saladin, in a moment of fearless sacrifice, stepped forth before Caiatl and said that he would honor her. He forfeited his own life in place of Crow's. Bravery like this was something to be celebrated in the eyes of the Cabal. Saladin had offered his own life in a form of payment. And whilst it would have been tradition for him to die, there was something else that could be done.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Caiatl could finally achieve what she had always wanted—a Lightbearer on her War Council. And so she decided to conduct a different form of justice. Saladin's life from that moment would be forfeit, but it wouldn't mean his death. Instead, she demanded justice in the form of a lifetime of service from Lord Saladin. He would become her Bracus and serve her faithfully on the War Council of her Empire until the end of his days. This was something that was quickly agreed to by Zavala, who even told Crow not to say a word.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Humanity and the Cabal had been close in this moment to all-out war. We weren't just going to allow Crow to die. Saladin's moment of absolute bravery had saved diplomatic relations between the Cabal and humanity by preventing an all-out war. Even better, it had brought the two peoples closer. Now, the two were interlinked. A Guardian on Caiatl's War Council would also be able to represent us and put our interests into the Cabal's considerations. Even as many Cabal would protest the appointment, Saladin would need to prove himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He did so in the way of the Cabal—through the Rites of Proving. When there were some who came to challenge him, he defeated every challenger, and within the space of less than a week was promoted from Bracus to Valus. Thus, the newly anointed Valus Forge would be one of Caiatl's greatest warriors and was appointed command of his own Cabal legions. The legion under his command would be trained in a different manner than those typically seen in the Cabal Empire. Saladin would call them his Iron Warbeasts—his personal guard—and he would use his hundreds of years of training to create an elite fighting force amongst their ranks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks to bravery here, Caiatl and humanity would see closer cooperation in the months to come. And this would be important. Other forces were moving in the system. The Witness would quickly look to replace its first disciple. There would be one obvious contender—one who had already willingly offered himself up. And his ascension would be the next priority of the Black Fleet.
