                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Humanity's journey into space led to the discovery of the Traveler on Mars, sparking the Golden Age—a time of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and technological advancement. With the Traveler’s help, humanity colonized the solar system, transforming planets and creating wonders like near-lightspeed travel, SIVA nanites, Exos, and the Warmind, Rasputin. However, this era of utopia came to an end with the arrival of the Witness and the Black Fleet, signaling the Collapse and humanity’s fall into chaos.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> At last, our tale turns to humanity, who at the time were a primitive society, but even by the standards of most, we had accomplished a few marvels in our time. The creation of human culture and language, the splitting of the atom, the journey of a few brave souls into space. But it was in the early 2010s that the world held its breath as a signal was detected from our closest planetary neighbor, Mars. Something remarkable was happening. The world was changing, and perhaps most shockingly of all, it did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The events taking place on Mars defied scientific explanation. Hastily, the three greatest powers on Earth at the time assembled a joint task force: the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People’s Republic of China joined forces to send an astronaut, a cosmonaut, and a tychonaut to Mars to investigate. The project was originally known as Project Catamaran, but it would be remembered in history as Ares One. And so it was that on a fateful day in the year 2014, the explorers Mihaylova, Qiao, and Hardy became the first humans to step out onto the surface of another planet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They were unsure of what they might find when they arrived, and while all hoped for a peaceful encounter, they had been armed in case of hostility. Across mountainous terrain and through uncharacteristic Martian winds, they trekked toward the signal’s source, anticipation building with every step. As they crested the ridge, they saw it—the source of the signal and the reason for the disturbances. Together, they beheld the entity that would change the fate of humanity forever: the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beneath its radiant splendor, they bore witness to the first Martian rains in human history and saw life return to the Red Planet. But this was not simply the greatest discovery in all of human history—it was the start of a time of great prosperity for all the people of Earth, just as it had been for so many civilizations before. This time would be known to us as the Golden Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like the thousands that had come before us, the Traveler gifted humanity with the Light’s bounty of creation. The changes to humanity were apparent almost immediately. The nations of Earth and all its peoples entered a time of utopian peace and prosperity, with the Traveler’s bounty effectively doing away with all forms of war and prejudice. The lifespan of every human tripled, and we did not grow frail in old age. Those at the age of 90 were considered relatively young and highly capable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was recorded that during the Golden Age, some humans were born with a remarkable gift. They were able to hear the Traveler through involuntary dreams and sudden premonitions. These individuals were known as the Dreamers and would one day be known as Speakers, and their words were observed with reverence and respect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We expanded out into the system of Sol and established marvelous colonies—an endeavor made easier by the Traveler, which had begun to terraform our worlds into hospitable planets. Mercury became a garden world and the breadbasket of the system, Venus was transformed into a lush planet of jungles and rivers, and Titan was given a breathable atmosphere alongside its oceans of methane. Humanity expanded to all these places and more as the Traveler changed the worlds around us from hellscapes into havens.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Great cities rose from these formerly inhospitable places, from the marvels of the Arcologies of Titan to the spires of the Martian city of Freehold. Humanity took root and flourished in Sol. Many institutions rose to power, the most renowned being the thriving new technology firms and research groups throughout the system. There was the Ishtar Collective, primarily based on Venus, where they discovered the Vex ruins that predated humanity by billions of years. Their study of the Vex brought about technological marvels and new understandings of the universe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, there was probably the most infamous corporation to ever exist in the Golden Age, whose legacy can still be found scattered across the system to this day: the Clovis Bray Corporation. Named after its less-than-humble creator, Clovis Bray I, it was responsible for starting entire research and development colonies, as well as sponsoring scientific innovation in countless areas—from artificial intelligence to artificial personhood to aerospace defense. The remnants of Clovis Bray facilities can still be found across Sol, from Earth to the Moon, to Mars, and even on distant Jovian moons. The corporation collaborated with various national governments and held significant power and influence across humanity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps the greatest legacy of humanity’s Golden Age was our technology. In this era, we saw the creation of inventions that might have seemed indistinguishable from magic to those living back in the 21st century. Humanity quickly developed spacefaring craft capable of remarkable feats of transportation, including the first near-lightspeed jump drives. We also created Glimmer, a programmable matter that could be turned into almost anything imaginable when used in combination with the correct energy sources and matter forges.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On a grander scale, Willa Bray, one of Clovis Bray’s granddaughters, pioneered a project known as SIVA. This was a nanite technology that could be commanded to construct and create anything conceivable as long as it was given the correct inputs and control. The speed with which these nanites could construct something from seemingly nothing was revolutionary. Some speculate that the great cities of the Golden Age colonies were built so quickly due in part to this technology. SIVA could even convert surrounding matter into more nanites, allowing it to replicate rapidly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also discovered a new, more pure state of matter: Engram. Information and energy could be stored and encoded within an Engram with near-perfect precision. While they would decay over time, Engrams became a valuable means of storing data, and they can still often be found in the wild, decrypted and materialized into whatever they contained.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But undoubtedly, the two most remarkable inventions of the Golden Age were the Exos and the Warmind. Exos had long been theoretical. The idea was simple: human consciousness stored digitally in a mechanical body, allowing the person to live on with immortality inside their mechanical shell. This idea became the obsession of Clovis Bray I, who desired immortality and believed he would be the one to guide humanity into a new era of man—an era in which they would surpass even the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Exominds had been created before in the Golden Age by others, but they universally failed, as the spark of the human mind dimmed and went out every time. The first hint to the secret of true Exos was discovered on the Moon. A project overseen by Clovis Bray’s grandson, Alton Bray, had uncovered something terrible but powerful: the so-called K1 artifact, buried on the Moon. It was known as the Anomaly and had inexplicable properties, chief among them being the hallucinations and nightmares suffered by the crew. Clovis visited the site, and while others experienced hallucinations, he heard something entirely different—a voice guiding him to the distant moon of Europa, promising in his dreams that he would discover the secret to his ascension.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Europa, Clovis discovered what he would call Clarity Control, a statue of a tall veiled figure beneath the moon’s icy crust. This would be the first of many statues of Darkness that humanity would find, always veiled, black as obsidian, and brimming with dark power. Thanks to his visions, Clovis realized that he would also need to construct a Vex gate. The combination of these two factors—the Vex radiolarian fluid, or mind fluid, and the influence of the veiled statue—was key to the creation of stable Exo mind fluid. At a site that would be known as the Deep Stone Crypt, a mass of Exos would emerge and begin to trickle down into human society.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Little did Clovis know that the K1 artifact and Clarity Control were fueled by Darkness and that he might have played into the grand designs of agents beyond his comprehension.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Warmind was the other invention of Clovis Bray that defined the Golden Age, though his granddaughter Anastasia Bray was closely involved in its development. The Warmind would eventually surpass even Clovis Bray himself. It would be inaccurate to call the Warmind simply an AI—it was a superintelligence refined over years and given an unfathomable amount of processing power. The Warmind was far more than any administrative or defensive intelligence. Its original template had been derived from the Ares One mission, where it was a smaller AI nicknamed R. It would be given a new name under Clovis Bray and Anastasia Bray: Rasputin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rasputin’s systems were so vast that he sometimes split himself into different subminds to partition tasks into different working groups. This even gave rise to the theory that there were many great Warminds, of which Rasputin was the greatest. Charlemagne, Malahayati, Martel—all of these ancient names, once thought to be great virtual defenders working in parallel, were in fact just parts of Rasputin. Yet, they had their own thoughts and perspectives, and they would name Rasputin according to his influence, giving him the moniker of the Tyrant.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rasputin’s mandate as the Warmind was simple: to be humanity’s shield, protecting us from threats that might come from the stars. He was linked with almost every possible piece of infrastructure to assist with this goal. Every vessel, every satellite, every automated weapon system could have been commandeered by Rasputin at a moment's notice in an emergency. Rasputin even employed a small private army of loyal human and Exo forces known as Seraphs. When manual intervention was required, they represented the long arm of the Tyrant’s will.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although Rasputin lacked any paracausal abilities, he was still the most advanced intelligence ever created. This was evidenced when his significant computational power managed to overpower even a Vex and save an entire Ishtar Collective research team. Rasputin was capable of devising solutions to problems before they arose, leading to the creation of remarkable weapons. His greatest weapon was undoubtedly the Warsat network, which spread throughout the system, continually launched from Mars. Each Warsat was armed with sensors, communication systems, and ordinance packages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clovis Bray I once planned to do the unthinkable: replace the Traveler with Rasputin. In his hubris, he engineered the possibility for Rasputin to strike down the mysterious sphere, inserting a protocol called Abhorrent Imperative into the Warmind’s code, allowing him the option to do just that should the Traveler abandon humanity. This could have led to disaster, but Clovis Bray was not the only one working on Rasputin. Anastasia Bray was concerned with Rasputin’s capacity to understand the worth of humanity. If Clovis gave Rasputin his mind, then Anastasia gave him his soul. Thanks to her lessons, Rasputin locked Clovis out of his systems, realizing that Abhorrent Imperative should never be used.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even to his final moments, Rasputin’s love of human culture was reflected. If you ventured into his bunkers, every once in a while, you could hear Tchaikovsky playing in the background.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With all of humanity’s newfound prosperity and its security guaranteed by the Warmind, we set our sights further afield. This was the time in which a colonization program known as the Exodus Program was conceived. Dozens of colony ships were constructed, each packed with colonists and shipboard systems that would propel humanity to the stars beyond Sol. The Exodus vessels were designated by color: Exodus Red, Exodus Blue, Exodus Indigo, and Exodus Black. Under the supervision of General Chen Lanshu, these vessels were assembled and launched from the Cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Negotiations with Clovis Bray were even undertaken to place SIVA nanites aboard each vessel to assist with colonization efforts or defense, should the need arise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Golden Age and all its prosperity had been a great boon to humanity, but as history has shown, this time of peace was not to last. There were signs that it would one day come to an end, but most were ignored. Even as Rasputin worked quickly to counter the oncoming threat, it became apparent that there was little that could be done to halt the coming storm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like so many before us, humanity would experience an apocalypse, all too familiar to those blessed by the Traveler’s Light. The forces of the Witness were on the march, and the Black Fleet loomed on the edges of our system. We were powerless to stop what happened next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The end of the Golden Age had finally come. The Collapse had begun.
