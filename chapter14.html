                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the death of Crota, the Reef calls upon the Guardians to hunt Skolas, the escaped Kell of the House of Wolves, whose madness drives him to unite the Fallen and wield forbidden Vex technology in a bid for dominion. With Mara Sov’s command, Petra Venj’s precision, and Variks the Loyal’s insight, the Guardians pursue Skolas across Venus and Earth, thwarting his ambitions and ultimately capturing him. Yet his cryptic warning of a greater darkness sets the stage for ominous alliances and prophecies. In the end, Skolas meets his fate in a trial by combat—but his fall is only the calm before a far greater storm: the coming of Oryx.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> It is not a common thing for the Awoken of the Reef to seek out assistance. It is even rarer for them to seek it from the likes of Guardians. And yet, Mara Sov had seen how we had dispatched the son of Oryx, and so we had at least proven our competence in battle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And that competence was needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Skolas, the Kell of the House of Wolves—whom Mara had defeated in the Reef Wars—had broken out of the Prison of Elders. The exact details of this breakout aren't known, but it appears to have occurred with the assistance of the Nine. Why they did this is something of a mystery, but what we do know is that they gifted Skolas with a Ketch, one of the great Fallen warships. With this, he had an opportunity to call his forces back to his side.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many corsairs of the Awoken would die in the ensuing chaos, and a few infamous Fallen Wolves—who would come to be known as the Queenbreakers—even attempted an assassination on Mara Sov herself. Corsairs died in her defense, and her fury was palpable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the traitors turned tail and fled, Mara tasked us and her recently appointed Queen's Wrath, Petra Venj, with hunting down Skolas and all the treacherous Wolves. We would also be assisted by Variks the Loyal, the same scribe of House Judgment who had originally betrayed Skolas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We quickly discovered that his Fallen Wolves were converging on the Simiks-Fel, the Ketch on Venus that had once housed the leadership of the House of Winter—namely, the Winter’s Kell, Draksis. We briefly interrupted Skolas, who was making a proclamation before the crew of this Ketch. Variks translated this, and as it turned out, Skolas was proclaiming himself to be an Eliksni legend—the so-called Kell of Kells—who would unite all the Eliksni houses, have all servitors and Ketches bent to him, and even receive the blessing of the Traveler itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before we could defeat Skolas and put an end to such delusions of grandeur, he escaped—and had succeeded in rallying what remained of the House of Winter. Our first mission was a failure, but we didn't let that stop us. Quickly, we managed to pick up his trail again, and we headed to Earth in order to cut Skolas off.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was heading there to try and integrate the forces of the House of Devils and House of Kings into his growing armies, using either force or diplomacy. But our arrival, in both cases, scuppered all of Skolas’ plans before they could even bear fruit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With pressure being put upon the Wolf Kell, and with no other houses of significant power to turn to in the system, Skolas looked for other means of conquering his foe—and his madness could be seen here. He desperately sought out an advantage from the Vex.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He made a small raid into the now-weakened Vault of Glass and successfully tapped into some of the Vex technology there—a testament to both his madness and the skill of his splicers, who even deployed a few weakened Oracles to try and wipe us from existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the danger Skolas presented rising, it was becoming incredibly important for us to capture him with all haste. His forces were raiding more Vex installations, including the ominous Citadel on Venus—the massive Vex spire that pierced toward the sky. They were hoping to use its technology for their advantage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately for Skolas, his movement to the top of the Citadel left him cornered. We ascended to the top of the spire, at the very height of the Citadel, and there we battled with the Kell of Wolves. Even as he used Vex technology to pull his house through time, Skolas was outmatched and fell before us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was captured by Mara Sov and Petra Venj, and he was promptly returned to the Prison of Elders. The Wolf Kell would stand trial—but not before being interrogated by Variks and Mara. Skolas told them, in a moment of fear, that despite the malice they had dealt to him, there was an even greater force headed this way—a darkened, looming shadow that would crush all with its presence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Later, Mara would prophetically dream of this foe. She saw what was to come, and knew that it could spell her doom—and the doom of the whole system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many envoys went back and forth from the Reef in those days. In particular, Eris Morn, Osiris, and Mara Sov would all meet, convening to discuss the threat that they would soon encounter. But more than simply this, the three would discuss the nature of the ultimate enemy they would need to confront—lest they should witness its wrath for themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And thus, a plan of loose cooperation was devised between the three of them, and a plan to address Oryx was formed. It would be a plan of many steps and phases, one that would evolve and shape its foundations over time. But it would first be set into motion months later by Mara Sov's choices over the Rings of Saturn—and its consequences would echo across the Ascendant Realms forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But before such plans could be enacted, there was one last complication to deal with: Skolas was still alive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Given what approached on the horizon, the Reef could ill afford a second breakout. And so, in the ways of old of the Eliksni, the Wolf Kell was sentenced to trial by combat. We would be his chosen executioners.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we entered the Prison of Elders and fought the hordes of Skolas’s minions who had been imprisoned there. The Wolf Kell was fierce, and did everything in his power to destroy us. But we had already destroyed gods in our short time as Guardians. Even with his many tricks—and his minions being flung at us left, right, and center—this pretender prophet, this so-called Kell of Kells, was nothing more than a charlatan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was no match for our Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Skolas the Rabid would be vanquished. The Wolf Kell was no more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For a short time, things seemed calm across the system, and we reinforced—preparing for our next battle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Little did we know that what we would soon be engulfed in was no battle, but a war. A war against one of the greatest champions of the Darkness that the system had known since the Collapse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For only recently, we had slain Crota—and his death rattle had echoed out across the night.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And now, the night would answer.
