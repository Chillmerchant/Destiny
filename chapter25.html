                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>As the Black Fleet descends upon the Solar System, Rasputin’s last stand fails and humanity’s protectors are forced to confront an ancient, unfathomable power. Osiris plants the Seed of Silver Wings on Io under Mara Sov’s guidance, drawing both Light and Darkness to the Tree that grows there. Eris Morn, the Drifter, and the Guardians seek to understand the truth behind the conflict, discovering that Light and Dark are not good and evil, but cosmic forces without morality. As the Black Fleet consumes the worlds of Mercury, Io, Titan, and Mars, heroes make their final stands and sacrifices, and the Traveler awakens to defend itself once more—while a new power, born of darkness, waits on the frozen world of Europa.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Before the Black Fleet's arrival, Rasputin was approached by the old warlock Osiris. Felwinter had been Osiris's mentor, and so it was natural for the warlock to approach with skepticism. He asked Rasputin which side of this great conflict it was on. He did not trust the old Warmind, especially after he had killed his mentor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Rasputin would oblige Osiris by giving him the coordinates to some kind of deep-space anomaly. From this anomaly, Osiris took a seed of Silver Wings. We do not know if this place was one of the Pyramid ships of the Black Fleet. We do not know if it was something older, deeper, darker.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Mara Sov's direction, Osiris would plant this seed in the Cradle on Io—the last place the Traveler had touched down. The seed grew into something magnificent: a second Tree of Silver Wings. And as if drawn to its luminous boughs, the shadows soon followed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Black Fleet was here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The return of the Pyramid ships to the system brought with it a dread unlike any that had been felt before, save for in the Collapse. Within the opening moments of their arrival, Rasputin did as he had sworn he would—and responded with the full measure of his new power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At first, it looked as though he was successful. But that notion was swiftly cast aside, as the Warmind, in but a single moment, was all but destroyed. Our greatest protector had given his fullest measure at the first opportunity, but it was not enough to stop even a single vessel of the Black Fleet. For showing his teeth, Rasputin had been quickly defanged.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were drawn to the Black Fleet on Io—to one of their vessels that parked above the Cradle where the Traveler had once sat. We were sent there to investigate, but were swiftly abducted once more by the Pyramid. It was in this moment that we could have been pulled into darkness and never seen again, but something remarkably unexpected happened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A Hive portal opened up in front of us and transported us briefly to the Ascendant Plane before spitting us back out in the lower reaches of the approach to the Cradle. Someone had just prevented us from speaking with the Black Fleet—and we would later discover that it was Savathûn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As time went on, it became clear that each week she was trying to prevent us from properly reaching the Tree of Silver Wings that Osiris had planted, where the Black Fleet was reaching out to us to communicate with our Guardians.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris Morn had gone ahead of us, and thanks to her additional knowledge—gained from interpreting the later messages of the Artifact on the Moon—she had attained significant insights. Those insights would repeat each week, allowing us to continually gain more and more knowledge from our invaders. But each week, as we attempted to approach and learn more of the Black Fleet, Savathûn would try to stop us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her whims were carried out by another defeated supplicant from our past: Nokris, who had unbound himself from Xol’s service and newly dedicated himself to Savathûn instead. As part of his supplication, he had gifted Savathûn the knowledge of Hive Necromancy—something that should have been heresy for her to reflect upon. And yet, perhaps it showed a greater intent as to what she was hoping to accomplish, and the direction in which she was veering.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, a cycle of battles began. Every week at the Vanguard’s behest—and with great caution—Eris Morn at our side, we would secure the site of the Tree of Silver Wings and learn what we could of our foes from our foes. It seemed, over time, as though they were trying to tempt us—to invite us to use Darkness, to join their side.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were others who were also unsatisfied with this limited perspective we were receiving from the Black Fleet. Chief among them was the Drifter. He had used the Light and Dark before and knew that our understanding was… incomplete.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He made a request of the Nine—asking them to explain the nature of Light and Dark. Alongside us and Eris Morn, we experienced a vision of sorts. We were transported deep into the Drifter’s Haul, where we witnessed what would be referred to by the Nine as a prophecy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this place that the Nine had crafted, we learned through actions and experience that the Black Fleet was here to take and invade our worlds—and that soon, they would be lost to us. In particular: Mercury, Io, Titan, and Mars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More importantly, it gave us a revelation that would be further reinforced as the years went on. It showed us that the Light and Dark were not strictly forces bound to the perspectives of good and evil as we had believed. They were elemental forces of the universe, as fundamental as time and gravity—no more moral than a subatomic particle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This revelation was utterly fundamental for us to understand what would come next. It gave us our first hint that the Black Fleet was not actually the truest form of Darkness, but a usurper that had used it as a tool—someone or something capable of manifesting it with great potency, but not its true source, not its true master.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It also quietly pointed to the opposite possibility: that the Light could be wielded by one deemed evil by us—an idea that would matter well before the end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we continued to communicate with the Black Fleet, we began to see the Tree of Silver Wings change. Every atom within its structure was being fought for by the paracausal energies of Light that remained on Io and the emerging Darkness of the Pyramid vessel above. Every element within its structure was changing—and the Darkness was winning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be but one sign of many. Our worlds were potentially doomed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After many tests, it was determined that the Pyramid vessels were impregnable. Nothing could get past their shielding technology. Nothing could break through. Ashamir even discovered that when struck, the vessels teleported all hostile munitions into a different dimension. They did not even detonate—they did not even strike their targets true.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The worlds under threat were given an order by Commander Zavala: prepare for a general evacuation and retreat to the Last City. Many followed this order, but some decided to stay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Mercury, the Assyrian cultist Brother Vance stepped forth into the Infinite Forest to understand more of the beautiful dark song that the Caloris Spires had made. His fate is unknown, but it is speculated to have been grim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Titan, the Vanguard’s deputy commander Sloane discovered a Golden Age power suit that granted her an unparalleled degree of strength. She stayed behind to hold off the forces that claimed Titan for their own, knowing she would fight alone, might never win, and would face these trials in the deepest darkness imaginable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Io, the warlock Asher Mir decided to stay, attempting to prevent the secrets of the Vex Network from falling into the possession of the Black Fleet. As we left for the last time, he entered the Pyramidion—where he had lost his arm to the Vex mind Brakion years ago—and immersed himself into the Vex Network, becoming a whisper within its code. There, he could discover the secrets the Vex held—secrets crucial for us to uncover in the coming years, secrets that would lead him to the Veil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Mars, the hunter Ana Bray decided to retreat—but not before salvaging everything she could of the Warmind. Thanks to her Ghost, Jinju, and some quick thinking, she was able to save a massive portion of Rasputin’s core code and store it within a pillory engram. She returned to the Last City with this engram and the remains of a project that would occupy her for years: a prototype Exo-body that would serve as a framework to rebuild the Warmind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, Mars, Io, Titan, and Mercury were all abducted by the Witness and its Black Fleet—taken by the same power that had allowed Oryx to create his Taken. For a time, these worlds were lost to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But before they were taken completely, we were able to commune with the Black Fleet one last time, as corruption consumed the Tree of Silver Wings. Once more, we were intercepted in this last, most pressing moment—and we were drawn into what we believed was the court of Savathûn, taking the fight directly to Nokris himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His true death rang out across the Ascendant Plane, and in its aftermath, he was no longer there to prevent the Pyramids from abducting us deeper into their innermost chambers. Our Ghost was possessed again—its voice changing to what we had heard when we first ventured into the Pyramid on Luna, the same voice that had spoken to us in the Vision of the Black Garden. Barely a year had passed, and it was back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It told us that ancient power awaited us on Europa—and that it would be ours for the taking.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also saw a strange scene before us: a Pyramid vessel within a Pyramid vessel, an effigy of it floating before us, surrounded by adoring worshippers from many different species.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this final message from the Black Fleet in our minds, and the worlds we had once called our territory now abducted, we gathered in the Last City and bore witness to an event as terrifying as it was majestic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the Black Fleet’s return, the Traveler was responding—reacting to the encroaching Darkness. As its old enemy had returned, it began to reform itself. The broken pieces of its shell that had orbited it since the end of the Red War began to slot back into place. A wave of great Light across the system signaled the Traveler’s response to the Black Fleet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It would defend itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The question remained: what would its Guardians do when tempted with an entirely different kind of power—a power that awaited us in the icy heart of Europa?
