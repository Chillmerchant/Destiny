                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>As the Coalition of Guardians, Cabal, Eliksni, and Awoken rises to stand against the Witness, their unity faces its first great trial aboard the corrupted Leviathan. Emperor Calus seeks to bind himself to the Pyramid of Luna and ascend as a Disciple, forcing Eris Morn to lead a painful ritual to confront and weaponize the nightmares haunting Crow, Zavala, and Caiatl. Through the ordeal, each faces the ghosts of their past—Uldren Sov, Safiyah, and Dominus Ghaul—and emerges transformed, their fears turned to strength. Delving into Calus’s fractured mind, they uncover that his greatest shame is his love and loss of Caiatl. In the end, the Coalition severs Calus’s bond to the Pyramid, but their victory is bittersweet, as old wounds remain and a darker presence, Nezarec, stirs once more.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Our close alliance with the Cabal and the other forces within the system would morph into a wider cooperative force as time went on. The Eliksni of the House of Light and the Awoken of the Reef would join Caiatl's Ascendancy and the Guardians of the Vanguard to form what would be known as the Coalition. Together, we would stand as the last bulwark against the Witness and its desire to impose the Final Shape upon the universe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first test for this fledgling alliance would arrive soon above Luna in the form of the Leviathan. It had previously disappeared after the Black Fleet had taken our worlds, but now it had returned. Instead of the opulent gold trimmings and white marble that it had once displayed, it was now infested with the same Egregore fungus that we'd found on board the Glykon. Worse still, the Leviathan was attempting to forge a link—one between its own systems and those of the Pyramid of Luna that awaited below.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of this was being done at the direction of Emperor Calus, who was making these preparations in order to begin his ascension into a Disciple of the Witness. He needed to bind himself and his mind to the Pyramid of Luna. His success would grant him incredible power, but failure might buy us precious time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nightmares from the Pyramid began to entrench themselves aboard the Leviathan as the energies of the two vessels began to merge. Members of our Coalition were personally targeted as we attempted to board the Leviathan and stop Emperor Calus. Some amongst our number, like Ikora Rey, stayed away from this threat. Her nightmare wore a painful face—the face of Cayde-6. Others had to face their fears and sought Eris Morn’s counsel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Much to their disappointment, the only way to solve this problem would be painful. Eris used her magics to bind them together in a ritual with the Crown of Sorrow. By binding our nightmares to the Crown, we were able to pass into the deepest parts of the Leviathan and protect ourselves from the nightmares. The Crown could also be used to contain and release these nightmares in conjunction with a device of Eris’s making—the Nightmare Harvester, a wicked contraption that directed the torment of our foes and allowed us to control the forces of Nezarec’s waking vessel, dominating them in the same way they had once dominated us. Manifestations of fear would no longer stop us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite our newfound alliance, Empress Caiatl initially rejected taking part in any such ceremony, calling Eris’s witchcraft a danger to the cause. After all, Torobatl had fallen because of Hive sorcery, and it was predictable that the Empress would be less than pleased with Eris’s solution, considering what had happened to Gahlran previously on the Leviathan. Too many Cabal had already been lost by meddling in Hive sorcery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But those of us who had spent significant time around Eris, fighting off the Hive gods and delving into the occult, understood that this was our best chance. And so we entered into the binding ritual alongside Crow and Commander Zavala. Each of them would be haunted by unique nightmares—nightmares that tore at their psyche and gave them the greatest reminders possible of the pain of their past.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crow was haunted by an all-too-familiar nightmare: his former self, Uldren Sov. It taunted him across the Leviathan, quick to remind him of all the evil he had done in his past life and all the pain he had inflicted. He was reminded of the deaths of the Awoken, the Barons he had unleashed upon the Reef, and the murder of Cayde, which had harmed so many people he’d come to love. Only by facing his shame and understanding that he could use these experiences to become a better man would Crow find peace.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala was haunted by grief—a grief born from a long-lost part of his past: his wife, Safiyah. He had been driven to a depth of sorrow that was hard to fathom. He had failed to protect their adopted son, Hakim, back in the Dark Ages. During his training as an Iron Lord, he had left Saladin’s tutelage to start a family with Hakim and Safiyah. But his failure to protect his son haunted him for the rest of his days, and he would continually ask his wife for forgiveness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was nothing to forgive, even as he kept asking. Ultimately, they separated—something that drove the pain even deeper. Safiyah remarried and had a daughter, and when she passed, her family line would see Zavala visiting each generation. He continued to ask for forgiveness, an unending torment folding inward down the generations. The Commander had asked so many times that the grief itself had become built in—a sorrow that few could fathom. Ultimately, the only person Zavala needed to forgive was himself, and in doing so, he was able to press forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Both Crow and Zavala faced many challenges, but they persevered and conquered their nightmares. They were manifestations of darkness, but not necessarily evil. The nightmares turned into memories—positive manifestations of darkness that reminded them of their strength, the trials they had endured, and how far they had come.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They were not alone. A third member of their cadre needed to confront her own nightmares: Caiatl. Her nightmare manifested in the form of Dominus Ghaul, a figure she had long admired. Yet she knew his ways were insufficient for the times at hand. The Cabal needed to change, but Caiatl was overtaken by the burden of responsibility and the failure to defend her homeworld. She was defenseless against the nightmares until Eris convinced her to join the Guardians in the binding ritual.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With their help, Caiatl faced Ghaul again with renewed strength and greater resolve. She understood that his ways were relics of the past, and that her path could chart a better future for the Cabal—not one of her father’s greed or Ghaul’s brutality, but her own way: a way of honor, cooperation, diplomacy, and alliances. A new Cabal that would grow beyond their restrictive past.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the nightmares turned into memories, we were all guarded against Calus’s defenses. It was time to infiltrate the heart of the Leviathan. Yet there were other avenues for us to investigate. During her exploration of the ship’s inner chambers, Eris Morn discovered the old Tribute Hall that Calus had once dedicated to us. There, she found a statue containing a thread of Calus’s mind. She ensnared that thread and crafted a ritual that would allow us to infiltrate the inner reaches of Calus’s psyche. Using this, we could understand his motivations—and his weaknesses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, the mind heist began.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What we saw was that Calus’s mind had been cleft in two. There was a duality within his soul. On one hand, a side tortured by the past and the people he had loved—or believed had betrayed him. On the other, a dark and reverent fervor driving him toward exaltation as one of the Witness’s Disciples. Purpose and regret sat side by side in Calus’s mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the heart of it all—beyond the Midnight Coup’s conspirators, beyond Gahlran and Calus’s failure to marshal the Hive—there was a greater shame. Calus’s greatest shame was also his greatest love: his daughter, Caiatl. She had been his betrayer, and that betrayal wounded him more deeply than any nightmare we faced. He knew he had failed her as a father, even though he believed he had tried. It haunted him more prominently than any other regret.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even in his final moments, he would think of Caiatl—and of his failure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Armed with this knowledge and protected against the nightmares of the Pyramid, we ventured back into the deepest parts of the Leviathan and fought to stop Calus before he could merge with the Pyramid. We were drawn into the Pyramid vessel itself in the process, and alongside Caiatl, we faced the nightmares once again. But this time, we were victorious.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In breaking them, we also severed Calus’s connection to the Pyramid, preventing his immediate transfiguration into a great Disciple of the Witness. Caiatl took one last moment to mourn the father she had known. There was nothing left of him; who he was had been lost to the Witness. The father she was forced to kill was not the same man she had once loved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala and Crow took a moment to say farewell to the manifested memories of Uldren and Safiyah. Their pasts had been put behind them, and though their scars would take time to heal, they were taking their first steps forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within the deepest reaches of the Pyramid of Luna, we stood victorious—broken, beaten, reckoning with our past—but still alive. Still united.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The strength of the Coalition had held, and soon it would be tested once more. Nezarec’s presence began to grow louder and louder, and soon our other allies would be called to hunt down those Echoes until they could at last be reunited.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And an all-too-familiar villain awoke from the ice.
