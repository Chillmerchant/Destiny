                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the wake of Cayde-6’s tragic death at the hands of Uldren Sov and the Scorn, the Guardians vowed vengeance, chasing the traitor and his barons into the lawless Tangled Shore. Their hunt unraveled a deeper corruption: Uldren, deceived by Riven, the last Ahamkara, unwittingly opened the path to the Dreaming City and unleashed a terrible curse. Though Mara Sov revealed her survival and charged the Guardians to strike down Riven, the dragon’s death only fulfilled Savathûn’s hidden wish, dooming the Dreaming City to an endless cycle of Taken corruption. Yet even amidst ruin, hope flickered, as the ghost Glint revived the disgraced prince as the Crow—a Lightbearer reborn, free of the sins that once defined him.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> As the conflict on Mars began to die down, Cayde and the Queen's Wrath, Petra Venj, had gone hunting. A new abomination had struck the Reef in recent months—a writhing mass of new Eliksni forces that were not quite alive. These dead, or rather undead, Eliksni were known as the Scorn. Tainted by some kind of dark ether, they could be raised again from the dead repeatedly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They were led by eight barons, whom the Hunter and the Queen's Wrath would work to capture successfully over a long campaign. In the process, they discovered that the true leader of the Scorn was an all-too-familiar face: a traitor, Uldren Sov, brother of the late Queen Mara. For their crimes, all of the Scorn and Uldren were locked away in the Max Security Wing of the Prison of Elders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As one of the barons, Fikrul the Fanatic, spoke to Variks the Loyal, he made it clear that the Awoken lacked a strong leader without Mara. Variks saw this and feared for the fate of his own people as well. But it was Uldren’s words that may well have pushed him over the edge, making him feel it necessary to perform his next, treacherous action.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Variks made off with his personal Aether supplies and released every prisoner within the Prison of Elders in order to cover his escape. Many terrible criminals were unleashed in the chaos—such as Eramis the Ship Stealer, Baron of the House of Devils—and most crucially of all, the Scorn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Petra recalled Cayde immediately to help her contain the prison break, and Cayde invited us along for the ride. Thanks to Cayde’s assistance, we were able to lock down the prison once and for all. But Petra had a deeper concern. She headed down to the Supermax Wing, where the barons and Uldren were being held, and discovered that they had all escaped. They were leaving via the airlock at the lowest part of the Prison of Elders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cayde destroyed part of the prison’s central processing hub and rode the debris down to reach them more quickly. Unfortunately, this left him isolated and alone, and it destroyed some of the routes we might have used to reach him faster. Alone, he faced off against the majority of the escaped Scorn. They were armed and ready for this moment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It wasn’t the falling clubs and gnashing teeth of the Scorn foot soldiers that overcame him. Among their number was a baron better armed than the rest—Pirrha the Rifleman. Taking a perch above the battlefield, he waited for the perfect moment to strike. He didn’t kill Cayde, though. He killed Cayde’s ghost, Sundance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cayde was left broken and beaten by his encounter with the barons. Without the Light, there was little hope. Prince Uldren then stole Cayde’s weapon, the Ace of Spades, and asked him if he had any last words. Moments before we could arrive at the scene, Uldren delivered the killing blow, fatally shooting Cayde-6.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we arrived, Uldren and the barons escaped, and Cayde passed away in our arms. We returned Cayde’s remains to the Tower. Though Zavala refused to commit forces to hunting Uldren—fearing the loss of more friends—Ikora’s heart burned with fire. So did ours. We told Zavala plainly that he would not need to commit any forces. For the first time since the Black Garden’s heart, we broke our silence. We spoke, and promised that Uldren Sov would die by our hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But before we pursued Uldren Sov, Ikora found something we needed to address. She had been having visions and dreams of Light, potentially sent by the Traveler. We followed those dreams to Io and were gifted with new understandings of our Light. With these new powers in hand, it appeared the Traveler was preparing us for what came next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To hunt the barons, we would need to head to the Tangled Shore—a lawless and wayward patch of space within the Reef’s territory, frequented by pirates and smugglers. Petra picked up on our signal shortly after we arrived and offered us assistance against the barons. That aid came in an unusual form: Eliksni. Criminal Eliksni, but allies nonetheless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was perhaps the first time we properly fought alongside allied Fallen. Yet these Eliksni did not work for Petra—they worked for the Spider, an Eliksni crime boss frustrated that the barons were cutting into his business on the Shore, having even driven him from his previous hideout. He agreed to give us their location in exchange for errands run in his stead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When he finally surrendered the barons’ location, they had fortified it into a stronghold of their own. Though we carved through countless Scorn, we arrived too late. The barons escaped, and we had to hunt them down one by one before reaching Uldren Sov.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we hunted them all: the Rider, the Mad Bomber, the Trickster, the Rifleman, the Hangman, the Mindbender, the Machinist. Eventually, we made our way to a heavily guarded Awoken Watchtower, where we faced the last of them—the Krull, the Fanatic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While we hunted, Uldren had been listening. His murder of Cayde had not been entirely his own decision. He had been guided by a spectral vision of his lost sister Mara, who told him to let the Reef burn, and that only he could free her from some dark prison. The vision guided him to the European Dead Zone, where he took a shard of the Traveler and brought it to the Tangled Shore’s Watchtower.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deep within that Watchtower, which linked to the Dreaming City, the corruption behind Uldren’s eyes grew. The darkness within him and the shard’s Light combined, opening a gateway in the inner chamber that led to the Dreaming City. The apparition of Mara thanked him, saying he had indeed been the key to freeing her.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But in truth, Uldren had unleashed a powerful Taken entity—a Chimera possessed of a greater mind far beyond the portal’s end. It quickly consumed him, swallowing him whole just as we arrived. We had to destroy this terrible monster. After defeating it, we found Uldren broken, beaten, and no longer bewitched, lying face-first before us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just as he had done to Cayde, we offered him his last words, the Ace of Spades held in dark offering of finality. It isn’t clear to this day who killed the Forsaken Prince, but his death created echoes across the years to come.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Petra wasn’t done. Regardless of whether we had pulled the trigger or she had, she insisted the work needed to continue. And it would—within the Dreaming City. She told us we needed to make contact with Mara Sov, and that we could do so if we returned to the Watchtower and stepped through the gateway Uldren had created.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other side, we caught our first glimpse of the Dreaming City, the Awoken’s most sacred place. Meeting Petra again, we reactivated an Awoken device called the Oracle Engine and heard the voice of Mara Sov. Unlike Uldren’s visions, this was no apparition. This was real.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As it turned out, the plans of Eris, Mara, and Osiris had borne fruit. Back at the Battle of Saturn, the Queen had known she would need to die, and that her death would leave Oryx exposed. She had prepared for this moment. Much like the Hive, she carved a throne world for herself out of the Ascendant Plane. With the help of her captured wish-dragon, Riven, she created Eleusinia, a throne that allowed her to persist beyond death.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the Dreaming City had been left vulnerable. In the opening moments of the Taken War, Oryx had breached it, corrupting Mara’s throne world and sending his agents into the city. It was now infested not just with Scorn, but with Taken as well. Hive broods descended upon the Awoken’s holy stronghold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Worst of all, Riven herself had been Taken by Oryx before we destroyed him. She had guided Uldren, fed him visions of Mara, and orchestrated Cayde’s death. Petra and Mara pieced it together quickly. Uldren may have pulled the trigger, but the true menace was Riven of a Thousand Voices, the last known Ahamkara.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The vengeance of a monarch who has lived a million years is swift and decisive. Without hesitation, Mara decreed that the Dreaming City should be opened to Guardians, and that we should assemble a team to hunt the last Ahamkara. The Awoken promised us the bounty of their realms if we succeeded.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We set out for the Queenswalk Spire, hearts set on vengeance. Perhaps it was already too late.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We began by freeing the Techeuns, Kalli and Shuro Chi, who told us they could contain Riven’s heart if we killed her. They warned us, though, against the strength of our desires. The longings of six immortal godslayers could feed a nation of Ahamkara—let alone one. We should have listened more closely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deeper into the Dreaming City, we faced powerful Taken and Awoken defenses that sealed Riven away. At last, we reached the Spire and confronted her titanic form. Empowered with Taken darkness, her strength as a dragon was nearly unmatched.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Racing up and down the Spire, we fought the last dragon, the last Ahamkara. At last, the killing blow was struck. All Riven could do was grant one last wish.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We brought her heart to the Techeuns, who contained it away. Yet Riven’s sirens still spoke, revealing that we had unwittingly given her the power to grant the wish of another dark entity. Our desire for her death had fed her gluttonously. She enacted the wish of another being who had visited her in her isolation: Savathûn, the Witch Queen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Between Oryx’s death and our arrival in the Dreaming City, Savathûn had crept in. She had made a wish of Riven, one that required immense power: that the Dreaming City should be Taken. With our strength fueling her, it was so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Dreaming City was cursed, trapped in a three-week cycle. The curse would grow in potency week by week until it crescendoed, only to begin again. Those trapped within its weft repeat the cycle endlessly, perhaps for all eternity. None can leave. None can flee. They live their fates forevermore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Riven’s final vengeance against the Awoken was not the destruction of the Dreaming City, nor Uldren’s death at Cayde’s avengers’ hands. It was the cursing of the Awoken people and their most sacred place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the cycle continued, Tower forces pressed in to learn its cause. Yet there was an unexpected spark of Light in the darkness. A ghost named Glint entered the Dreaming City, searching for his Guardian. He found an abandoned monument on a distant cliff. Beneath a funeral pole lay a body. Scanning it, Glint determined it was worthy of the Traveler’s Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was the one. This was his Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The man Glint raised had once been known as Uldren Sov. But as a freshly reborn Guardian, he had no memory of his past life—no recollection of the people he had killed, or the pain he had caused. He was a new person. His past life was not his to live.
                    <br>
                    <br>    
                    Soon, he would discover the truth of his former identity. But until then, he chose a new name. No longer Uldren Sov, the Forsaken Prince, he would be known as the Crow—a Lightbearer.
