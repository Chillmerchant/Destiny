                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the aftermath of the Collapse, humanity's fragile resurgence in the Last City is marked by bold ambition, tragic miscalculation, and heroic defiance. As Guardians rise to reclaim lost worlds, they suffer a devastating loss on the Moon to Crota’s Hive, sparking vengeful crusades and deep internal divisions. The exile of Osiris, the fall of legendary fireteams, and the looming threat of a united Fallen assault culminate in the Battle of Twilight Gap—where Lord Shaxx’s defiance turns the tide. As the City reels from war, betrayal, and fading Light, new traditions like the Crucible are born, and old heroes like Saint-14 vanish chasing answers. Just as hope begins to dim, a single Ghost finds their chosen Guardian among the ruins of Old Russia—and the next chapter begins.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Something that regularly proves to be a frustration when talking about Destiny's lore and its timelines is that the relatively early dates—before the actual foundation of the city, after the Collapse, and from then on—there are very few actual references to specific dates. The people of Earth had little time to record-keep, and as they fled for their lives, the days bled into each other. The months bled into each other. Thus, it is often hard to determine where one age begins and another ends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is no greater example of this than with the transition from the Dark Age to the City Age. Some say it began with the completion of the first of the city's walls. Others say it began at the conclusion of the Battle of the Six Fronts. Others still believe that it began with the formation of the Consensus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No matter the truth, the result is the same. The Guardians had arisen to find their city alive and full of hope for the future, and in their noble defense of the Last City, the Guardians pushed out into the wilds to deal with strange and deadly forces that had plagued our worlds. A new order was a real possibility that, at last, lay within reach.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Or so they thought, back in the days of the City Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These moments might have been separated by days; they might have been separated by centuries. But regardless, we know from the legends that stand before us even to this day that they did happen. There are small hints as to the chronology of things, but still, there are moments where details might be inaccurate. So, with that in mind, the events are chronicled in this order, as I believe they are indeed the correct order.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There must have been first a time of peace, where Guardians were allowed to reflect on their greatness, and when the City was assured of the supremacy of its defenders. It is perhaps the only thing that makes sense, because of the hubris of what happened next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The City was keen to expand its territory further. It started with small expeditions to the outer worlds of the system, and to the inner core. In particular, of note, Saint-14 had been tasked with leading one such group of survivors to try and recolonize Mercury, before realizing that it was overrun by the House of Rain. Whilst these initial failures had slowed them down, the Last City was still looking to reclaim humanity's lost wonders, and they set their sights in the same place that pre-Golden Age humans had long ago.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They looked to the Moon—our one true celestial neighbor within striking distance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The initial reports suggested that Luna was Hive territory, with a ragtag Fallen presence there too. The Consensus was committed to securing a foothold on the Moon and retaking it for humanity. Even as they realized it was also home to the Hive, they did not believe they could be stopped.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But in the meeting where the forces were being committed to war, and where the Consensus was ready to vote on an invasion of the Moon, they were interrupted by a Guardian called Lord Shaxx, a former Warlord of great renown and power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Shaxx was one of the most tested battlefield commanders in the City, and he knew in his gut that the assault on the Moon was a terrible idea. He had seen what the Hive could do. He remembered a key victory that the City had fought against them, a conflict they had barely won. It was known as the Battle of the Burning Lake. There, Shaxx had witnessed firsthand the power of the Hive's blades and understood that, in them, there was a potential answer to the Light of Guardians. They were not like any other force in Sol—they could summon the true powers of Darkness to their side.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But despite his pleas, Lord Shaxx was ignored, and the Guardians of the Last City began to assemble into the greatest army of Guardians that had ever been seen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A host of thousands would rally under the banner of the Cormorant Seal, led by the Praxic Order, and they would march on Luna with the intent of reclaiming humanity's stellar birthright. Unique weapons of war, such as the Thunderlord and its sisters Abaddon and the Nova Mortis, were created in preparation for the assault.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was meant to be the great liberation of Luna—but it would be known instead as the Great Disaster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon their arrival, the forces of Guardians would spread out to capture their objectives and encountered fierce resistance from the bands of Fallen they came across. But when they hit the depths of Luna, things changed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The hit-and-fade tactics of the Fallen were troublesome, but they were merely a band of exiles trying to scrape out a living on the Moon's harsh surface.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The real threat below were Luna's true rulers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the armies of the Hive emerged to engage the Guardians, the battle that commenced was titanic in scale. The Guardians saw the strength of this terrible power firsthand and were forced to face their champion at the height of his power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crota had arrived, and his brood washed over the army of the Cormorant Seal like a tide. With his sword, the Darkest Edge, in hand, Crota personally slew some of the Last City's greatest champions, including Wei Ning, one of the greatest Titans that ever lived. Their Light was drained by his blade, and their Ghosts were crushed into screaming knives that he used to murder them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Mare Ibrium, where the greatest part of the battle took place, Crota fought with a thousand knights at his back. The skies themselves turned green with soulfire, and when Crota’s sword fell, it cracked the surface of the Moon, creating deep green fissures that remain to this day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Guardians were pushed back, then routed entirely. A general retreat was sounded. The battle was lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris still believed that the Speaker wasn't listening to his warnings. He was correct, but the Speaker's irritation with him had gone even further at this point, preventing him from listening even to Ikora, who was standing in for Osiris at Consensus meetings. This inaction, as Osiris saw it, had even gone so far as to weaken the City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris claimed that, in particular, the defenses of the Last City were weak around an area known as Twilight Gap—a prescient prediction, though none would know it until much later. The Speaker reached his breaking point as the divisions between those that followed Osiris and those that rejected him grew to a boiling point.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a full session of the Consensus, the Speaker moved to exile the Warlock Osiris. The motion was presented in all its grandeur, with a great speech by the Speaker, and just as Osiris was about to be exiled, he arrived and declared that he would leave the Last City regardless, imposing exile upon himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ikora Rey from that day onward would hold his position as the Warlock Vanguard. Followed by his Ghost, Sagira, Osiris would head to Mercury to understand the Vex better and to prepare to face them should the need arise. A gaggle of cultist followers would leave the City too, heading out into the wilds to make their homes beyond the Speaker's influence. Some of them even followed Osiris to Mercury and set up a camp within the Caloris Spires.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Losing a few cultists is one thing, but Osiris' exile left tangible scars on the fabric of the City beyond even just a few people leaving. It was the first time that an internal force had split the City since the time of the Faction Wars. It was the first time it had truly been a single man. It was the first time it had been a Guardian that had caused it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While this hadn't spilled over into real conflict, it had split some of the Guardians from the Speaker's authority. Osiris' influence had started to inspire Guardians to act independently of the authority of the Vanguard. This weakened the City, as some of the legends that we had known for so long as great defenders instead headed out into the wilds and never returned.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most notable of those were those who followed on from Osiris's words that the Vex were indeed the most dangerous threat to the Last City and humanity. Of them, the most infamous were the Hunter Pahanin, the Warlock Praedyth, and the Titan known as Kabr, the Legionless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These three would head to Venus, to the most infamous fortress of the Vex that had been around in Sol for billions of years. They attempted to infiltrate and destroy the Vault of Glass.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So it was that they entered—but only one came out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hunter Pahanin witnessed the power of the Vex and was forced to flee against it, being haunted by it for the rest of his days. The Warlock Praedyth of the Future War Cult was lost within the deepest reaches of the Vault and was imprisoned there seemingly for all eternity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Titan Kabr was beaten back by the Templar and then drank of Vex Radiolaria, thus enabling himself to be consumed by the Vex completely and to become one with them. Before he died, he at least managed to drain what Light of his remained into a shield—a paracausal force known as the Aegis, which would break the unbreakable and let the Light into the Vault.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, some of humanity's greatest heroes would fall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Long ago, such individual legends being lost might have been borne by the Last City. But now they were occurring just as humanity was about to face its greatest test yet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Out in the system, scouts amongst the Hunters had noticed significant Fallen troop movement for some time. This was no coincidence. Long had the Houses waited and watched the Traveler with envy. They had always plotted the downfall of the City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But doing so was no small feat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the failure of the House of Devils at the Battle of the Six Fronts, it was clear that the Last City could not be taken easily. Not a single Fallen House would be able to assail the Guardians in their own home. But what about a united force? If there was not one House but many Houses attacking, then there was a far greater chance of victory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so it was that the four greatest Houses of the Eliksni coordinated together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Kells of the Houses of Devils, Kings, Winter, and Wolves would marshal their forces and send them to Earth. Together they would unite in the greatest host of Eliksni that the galaxy had ever seen—ready to defeat the Guardians, break their walls, and reclaim the Great Machine at last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The exact number of Fallen assembled in this battle is not made clear, but based on what little we know about the troop strength of the force being brought by the House of Wolves, it is easy to speculate that there must have been over a million Fallen in this army. Such a tidal wave of a force would have eradicated the Last City for good were it not for the actions of two staunch heroes who stood strong in their roles—one as a Sovereign and the other as a Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Houses began to make their moves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The House of Devils, Kings, and Winter were able to mobilize their forces more quickly and assembled on Earth with some haste. But the House of Wolves was not in the inner system. They were in the Jovian Moons, and they would need to pass through the asteroid belt with their many Ketches in order to reach Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was in this moment that their Kell made a fatal error. He stopped their Ketches at the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, known as Ceres.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What he didn't know was that this was firmly in the middle of the territory of the Awoken of the Reef.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara Sov, the Awoken Queen, was presented with a choice in this moment. She could allow the Wolves to pass through—thus allowing them to trample on Awoken sovereignty and let the Last City burn. Or she could intervene at this interruption and invasion, and she could put Awoken lives at risk in doing so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara had to choose to hide or to go to war.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And Mara would choose war.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A devastating first strike on the House of Wolves made use of a tremendously powerful gravitational weapon—an ancient set of beings known as the Harbingers. The Harbingers were so powerful that they destroyed the asteroid of Ceres and left 500,000 dead from the House of Wolves in this first opening engagement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is known as the Scatter, and it did exactly that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Wolf Kell was among the number of dead. And in this sudden action, Mara had allowed herself to be embroiled in a conflict of her own—a conflict with the House of Wolves that would be known as the Reef Wars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, the House of Wolves would regroup under a powerful leader known as Skolas the Rabid, but they were unable to continue onward to Earth until they had dealt with the Awoken threat. With that in mind, the Awoken had bought all the time that the City would need.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But as we’ll soon learn, even that almost wasn’t enough.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara Sov would continuously fight the House of Wolves to a standstill, up until the point at which one broke ranks with the Wolves—a scribe known as Variks the Loyal, of House Judgment. He saw that Mara Sov was a leader who might at least be able to ignite the Eliksni’s fires for loyalty and unite them under one banner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He gave her critical information that led to the defeat and capture of Skolas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Skolas would have called Variks a traitor, no doubt—but given that he’d already removed two of Variks’s arms, I feel as though Variks might not necessarily have cared. The remaining Wolves either bent the knee to Mara or were imprisoned alongside their Kell in Variks’s new jail, a facility that would one day come to be known as the Prison of Elders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With her victory here, Mara Sov had denied one of the Fallen Houses the ability to attack Earth and potentially reclaim the Great Machine. But she had also denied the greatest possible reinforcements in the system for the Houses of Kings, Winter, and Devils.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, there were only three Houses instead of four.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now there were only three Houses instead of four. But regardless, this was still the largest Eliksni army that had ever been marshaled.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Quickly, the Last City’s defense had to be organized.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lord Saladin Forge was in command, with his protégés Commander Zavala and Lord Shaxx at his side. As the last of the Iron Lords—aside from Lady Efrideet, who had fled long ago—Saladin was well-prepared for a siege and had great degrees of experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So did Lord Shaxx, and Shaxx also had an uncanny ability to see when a battle could be turned—something which would happen in the greatest and most heated moment of the battle that would ensue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, the actions of a single fireteam—Shaxx’s fireteam—would determine victory or defeat that day. And that fireteam was present at the weakened part of the City’s defenses that Osiris had pointed out to the Speaker himself: Twilight Gap.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, Lord Shaxx was forced to hold the line, which he quickly saw was starting to buckle and break.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Saladin also noted this and believed that this would be where the tide broke through. If they broke through, it would be the end of humanity. The forces of the Eliksni would overwhelm the City, and none would survive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lord Saladin made the awful choice of sounding a general retreat to the City’s ridgeback district, believing that might be the only place they could hold back the Fallen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Lord Shaxx knew that with such a move, doom would be guaranteed for the Last City—and so he disobeyed Lord Saladin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside his fireteam, Shaxx held the line—dying over and over, back to back—until eventually, reinforcements could arrive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Legends were born that day—not least among them, Ana Bray.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The same Ana Bray who had designed Rasputin in the Golden Age. She had been risen by the Light of the Traveler and had seen her name tag and badge on her person from the moment she was risen. She would remember her name, and so would many others, thanks to her actions in the battle that day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wherever her Golden Gun shot, a whisper of the Traveler’s Light would be left. These remnants of her Light would still be present to this day. It was also in this battle that she faked her own death, so that she might explore more of the legacies of her own family’s past without the interference of the Last City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The battle was fierce, but eventually the Guardians—with their rallied forces—would push the Eliksni back. The counterattack was decisive enough to help break the Fallen’s charge for good.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lord Shaxx and his fireteam had saved the Last City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The losses from the battle were staggering. A whole generation of Guardians was devastated, in more ways than can be imagined. The Battle of Twilight Gap would change the Last City forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It marked a point of remembrance—and a turning point in our story.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Guardians had held their own in an age of great uncertainty. But now the true danger of their foes was also made more clear than ever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some chose to look on Twilight Gap with remembrance. Feizel Crux and Victor Lomar, two of the City’s great industrialists and the creators of the Crux-Lomar foundry, would use this opportunity to design a new weapon of war in commemoration of the battle: the Gjallarhorn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Forged from the armor and Light of Guardians that had fallen that day, it was said to ring out with the power of the fallen, giving voice to their strife once more with the howl of wolves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Others looked upon Twilight Gap’s events and saw the City’s place as being ascendant. Never again would the Eliksni assemble a force of this size. Never again would they invade the City with the lofty dream of reclaiming the Traveler. They would be a broken people completely from this point onward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Others saw that the battle had left the City weak and endeavored to protect it against even those recovering foes that were on their way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    None would make a greater mark in this regard than Saint-14.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the blessing of the Speaker—and with a certain fury in his heart—Saint-14 viciously hunted the Eliksni across the system, becoming a legendary monster in their eyes. He hunted down the leaders and Kells who had fought at Twilight Gap, killing as many as he could get his hands on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These would be known as the Crusades of Saint-14, and they would come to a close when he went to battle the Kell of the House of Devils.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the time, the Devils were led by Solkis, whose might was so great that he managed to grab the Titan and hoist him clean from his feet, choking the life from him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a famously Titan move, Saint-14 summoned all the power he could, ready for one last strike in melee. There was just enough space to land the blow—but it wasn’t a punch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Winding back his neck, Saint-14 headbutted Solkis, the Kell of the House of Devils, so hard that this single strike was enough to cave in the Kell’s skull, killing him instantly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Saint-14’s helmet still has a dent from this fabled incident that can be seen even to this day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was ready to return to the Last City, but then the Speaker contacted him with new information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris had been seen on Mercury.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Titan changed course and went to search for his friend—his lover. He would find his way to the Infinite Forest, the Vex simulation engine that Osiris had begun to enter and study. Into the deepest recesses of the Infinite Forest, Saint-14 would disappear.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His seat on the Vanguard would be left empty for a time, for he did not return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When it was filled by Commander Zavala, it was assumed that Saint-14 had been lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Legends had begun to disappear. At this point, the City was still weakening. A rot was setting in. And it was in this moment that, smelling the blood of the City, the Concordat would rise and make things so much worse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The exact reason behind their rebellion isn't well known. Much of their history has been scrubbed from the Last City's records. What we do know is that they rose to overthrow the Speaker and the Consensus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their betrayal would lead to the ascension of a faction that replaced them: the Future War Cult.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their revolution was short-lived, and they were finally defeated in one of the Last City's towers by the Guardians and forces of New Monarchy. The Concordat and its leader, Lysander, would retreat into the wild, where they have remained ever since.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even to this day, when the Witness’s forces crowd all around us, we still know Lysander is out there, somewhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With so much calamity and so much conflict, Lord Shaxx felt it necessary to act.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He put a proposal to the Consensus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Guardians had always sparred against each other. As immortal beings with incredible might, they were able to resurrect after their deaths. Dying was not necessarily a problem for a Guardian—unless their Ghost was also killed. And so, there became a culture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Guardians would fight against each other and learn from their mistakes. Combats were sometimes collectively referred to as the Crucible, and these moments of fighting and infighting were often used to settle disagreements in a martial manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some Guardians, such as Ikora Rey, were notorious combatants in this regard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was Lord Shaxx who proposed a formalization of the Crucible under his watchful eye. He would organize matches to pit Guardian against Guardian, thus allowing their existing ranks to train in an environment where their deaths were not punished permanently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Consensus would agree to allow the Crucible to be conducted, and Crucible matches would become a part of the Last City's culture. Guardians of all stripes gained fame and fortune for their performance in the arenas of Lord Shaxx.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The citizens of the Last City would watch the televised conflicts, or would show up if some of those arenas were able to be viewed in person. Factions and weapon foundries would sponsor Guardians who were willing to bear their colors or insignias into battle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Betting on Crucible matches became a relatively common pastime, and fans would develop loyalties or attachments to individuals or teams that performed well within Shaxx’s Crucible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the Crucible being truly formalized, now what had merely been sparring sessions could be turned into a true training avenue. A new generation of Guardians were being put to the test and were being readied for war.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But there was still some time before these Guardians would be ready, and the Old Guard would suffer some terrible fates before their replacements could come in to take the reins.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most notable of these was Andal Brask.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He had volunteered to become the Hunter Vanguard after losing a bet with his close friend Cayde-6. Cayde had killed a terrible Fallen mercenary called Taniks the Scarred and had bet with his friend Andal that he’d do it first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Andal lost that bet—and that’s why he had the desk job: the Hunter Vanguard position, the one job no Hunter truly wants.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The only problem was that Taniks was more machine than monster, and wasn’t so easily killed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He would swiftly return to the fold time and time again—until he got lucky one day, and ended the life of Andal Brask and his Ghost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cayde realized his error, and realized that it was his overconfidence that had effectively gotten his friend killed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a moment of reverent self-sacrifice and a dedication to duty, Cayde took up Andal’s cloak.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To know the significance of this moment, you need to understand the important part of Hunter culture that their cloaks represent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They are full of meaning and stories. They are a representation of you as a person. When a Hunter cuts apart his lesser’s cloaks and adds it to their own, it is a proclamation of dominance. When a Hunter’s cloak is emblazoned with the insignia of their posse or faction, they are proclaiming undying loyalty.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And when a Hunter takes up the cloak of his fallen comrade—it is a vow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And Cayde vowed to honor the memory and sacrifice of his fallen friend.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, not only did he take Andal’s cloak, but he also volunteered to be the next Hunter Vanguard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As time in the City Age dragged on, things slowly began to fall into decay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the City’s walls were constructed and finished, there were eight towers that perched along its circumference—each manned by Guardians, Frames, FOTC force members, and members of the Stoneborn Titan Order. It was bristling with guns. It was well defended.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But as the City Age started to come to a close, all but one of these towers had fallen into disrepair and had been abandoned.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The enemies of the City were beginning to close in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The time of the great City Age heroes had seemingly come to an end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An old and familiar kind of Darkness began to creep in from the edges of the system. Known at the time only to a select few—including a single Cloudstrider known as Rohan, who had found a backdoor into the Black Garden—a terrible kernel of Darkness had been planted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A false copy of the Veil had been created. A copy that had been nurtured by the Vex of the Black Garden, and had been nothing but a source of poison for the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this new Darkness rising, and no one knowing of it, the Traveler’s Light began to dim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A warrior of great strength and resolve would be needed to deliver humanity from the approaching perils of this treacherous time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And their prayers were answered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, a Ghost continued its search for its Guardian, trekking across the wastelands of the old Cosmodrome at Baikonur—the wastes that were now referred to as Old Russia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, amongst the rusting cars and unassuming bones of the Collapse, on a small hill just before the old Cosmodrome’s walls, they found something.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They found hope.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They found you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with you, the whole world would be changed forever.
