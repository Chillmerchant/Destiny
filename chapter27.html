                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>As the war on Europa raged, a new threat arose in the Reef—Xivu Arath, the Hive God of War. Her influence spread through Cryptoliths that corrupted even the Cabal and Fallen, creating the Wrathborn. When Osiris lost his Ghost, Sagira, and his Light while pursuing her High Celebrant, he was saved by an unlikely figure: Uldren Sov reborn as Crow. Bound in servitude to the Spider, Crow fought alongside us to purge Xivu Arath’s forces, proving himself not the murderer of Cayde-6 but a new Guardian guided by the Traveler’s will. Through visions, redemption, and the rebirth of Hawkmoon, Crow embraced his true purpose—just as a greater power began to rise, heralded by the march of the Cabal under a new Empress.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> As the conflict on Europa continued to unfold, another front opened in the new war for the system—this time in the Reef. The Hive God of War had suddenly made her presence known. Savathûn and Oryx had wandered this system before, but now it was time for Xivu Arath to make her presence known.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris would investigate this new presence in the system as he discovered numerous Hive structures, biological in nature, known as Cryptoliths. They were of Xivu’s design and from her horde, capable of extending her control over minions under her command far and wide. But these were not simply Hive. Many Cabal and Fallen also fell under the sway of Xivu Arath, with these Cryptoliths acting as hubs of control. Those that succumbed to Xivu’s wandering strength were raised as what became known as the Wrathborn, a plague upon our system much like the other Hive abominations before them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Osiris continued his search and sought to understand more, he caught the wandering eye of Xivu Arath’s High Celebrant. Osiris was cornered, and in a moment where Xivu Arath unleashed her power upon him, he was struck down. In that moment of terror, Osiris survived—but his Ghost, Sagira, was destroyed. Osiris lost his connection to the Light that day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We swiftly pursued Osiris, who had chased the High Celebrant into the Hellmouth, attempting to secure vengeance for Sagira. However, without his Light, he was not only mortal but far weaker. He no longer commanded any of the forces he once had, and his aim of avenging his Ghost by taking on something far greater than a typical Hive overlord was a foolish ploy at best. His life was nearly ended by an ordinary Hive Knight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We found him just before the Knight struck—but so did a familiar face, stepping out of the shadows at the edge of our vision with an Awoken blade, gutting the Hive Knight before it could end Osiris. It was Uldren—or rather, Uldren’s risen form, the Lightbearer known as Crow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crow and Osiris returned with us to the Tangled Shore. As it turned out, in the two years since his resurrection in the Light, Crow had found himself in the employ of the Spider, who had discovered him and press-ganged him into service. The Spider secured Crow’s cooperation by placing an explosive charge beneath Glint’s outer shell, ensuring that if Crow ever stepped too far out of line, a simple flip of a switch could end his power, his Ghost, and his life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Given the number of times stray Guardians had discovered Crow and recognized the face of Uldren Sov—killing him for the pleasure of it—this was an imminent threat, one that Crow had to take seriously. He had seen a system that shot back at him at every opportunity, gave him no reason to trust others, and taught him that everyone was a danger no matter what. But these were not the concerns of the Spider. To him, Crow was simply another tool, and the Spider had bigger opportunities and problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He stated that we could have any treasure within his vast collection—his great horde—if we helped him hunt down Xivu Arath’s High Celebrant and rid the Shore of her influence. The presence of the Wrathborn was bad for business. We obliged, and over the coming months, we did just that—hunting down the High Celebrant’s minions and Wrathborn forces wherever we found them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this time, Crow slowly proved to be not only a valuable ally but also a completely different person from the man who had once coldly claimed the life of Cayde-6. He had a sincere drive to do good, a moral compass that bent strongly toward justice, and an unbiased love for the people of every species in our system—be they Human, Awoken, or Eliksni. Much like the oldest versions of Uldren Sov that Mara might have remembered from the Distributary, Crow saw the good in everyone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He delighted in telling stories to children. He delighted in the simple goodness of friendship. And we began to see for ourselves that there was indeed good in him—that this was not the same villain who had killed Cayde, nor the same cold prince we had met upon our first entry into the Reef. This was a different man. Uldren and Crow were not the same.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Working together alongside Crow, we managed to save him at least once during our hunt for the High Celebrant. The great Hive commander fled into the Ascendant Realm near the Dreaming City, but was taken down thanks to our combined efforts. Crow was thankful for our interference and ultimately realized that, working together, we could not only be friends but also a powerful team. We were the first Guardians he had truly worked alongside in any professional capacity for any extended period. There was kinship there, and he had proven himself an ally worthy of our time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We returned successful to the Spider, and when the time came to claim our prize, we named Crow—buying his freedom from the Spider’s shackles. It enraged the Spider, but a deal was a deal, and so he acquiesced. When Crow asked why, we gave him a simple answer: he was a Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was something Crow would learn to reaffirm as he began to receive visions from the Traveler. They manifested first as paracausal feathers that we followed across the system—feathers that spoke through Crow’s perspective. Through these feathers, we relived some of Crow’s dreams, and he confirmed to us that he had indeed been dreaming. Sometimes he saw a hawk; sometimes he was the hawk. These visions always led us to a shard of the Traveler in the EDZ.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We went to investigate this place, and there we found a paracausal hawk of pure Light. Following this hawk, just as Crow had done in his dreams, led us to the Shard of the Traveler. And there, something was waiting for us—a broken effigy of a weapon from our past: Hawkmoon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was nothing but a shell, but with the aid of the Light, it could be remade. This weapon was made of the same material as the Traveler’s outer shell—a paracausal flesh that grew and glowed with potential. As Crow unraveled more of his dreams and visions, the weapon slowly took shape into the paracausal tool he would one day call his own. Cleansing the corruption of the Taken allowed us to finally claim the weapon for ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After many pilgrimages to the Shard to improve upon Hawkmoon’s design, Crow too acknowledged the truth we had already seen. At first, he rejected the idea of being another puppet for a greater being in a grand game. But eventually, he saw the truth: he was a Guardian—an instrument of the Traveler’s will. He knew his place. He knew his purpose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In celebration of this revelation, there was much merriment and drinking, and Osiris gifted Crow something remarkable: a new set of robes, a new cloak, and a mask. Using the mask and this new garb, Crow could walk into the Last City without fear of other Guardians attacking him for knowing who he was.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And as the threat of Xivu Arath faded away, Crow had the chance to prove himself as a new and true Guardian. That truth would become clearer than ever in time—heralded by the sound of stomping feet and heavy metal. Once more, the Cabal were on the march.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But this time, they were not the Cabal we had known. The Scout Legions, the Red Legion—they were broken, their leaders scattered. This time, we would face not a Legion, but a people. Not an Imperium, but an Ascendancy. Commanded not by a Dominus, but by an Empress.
