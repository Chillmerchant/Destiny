                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the Collapse, the Awoken return to a fractured Solar System where the Eliksni, Hive, Cabal, and Vex battle for control. Humanity clings to survival, with some founding the hidden city of Neomuna on Neptune while others endure the chaos of Earth. The rise of the Iron Lords brings order amid anarchy, leading to the formation of the Last City and the first Guardians. As factions are unified under a fragile government and paracausal threats loom, a final tragedy unfolds when the Iron Lords fall to SIVA—a nanotech plague unleashed by Rasputin in a moment of jealous fear.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> As the Awoken were given their choice and some of them made their way to Earth, they found a Solar System in turbulent chaos. The Black Fleet and its disciples had been pushed back, but there were many other threats that rose in their absence. It isn’t known who arrived first or exactly when; records from this time are scant and next to non-existent. Such was the nature of history and technology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There would be no true date-keeping or timeline from this moment onwards—there would only be the vicious clawing cycle of night and day, season to season. What we do know is that, of the forces that appeared in Sol, the Awoken were clearly not the first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Eliksni’s long drift had come to a close, but not all of them had universally settled in the asteroid belt, as the Awoken had discovered. Arriving in Sol, many of the different houses of the Eliksni would spread out across the system to claim new territories. The House of Devils would claim Earth’s Cosmodrome; the House of Rain would claim the sun-soaked fields of Mercury. The House of Winter would claim the Ishtar Sink on Venus, and the House of Wolves would claim territory in the Jovian Moons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hardy scavengers and survivors that they were, the Eliksni’s resilient physiology allowed them to survive almost anywhere, so long as there were enough resources for their Servitors to turn into Ether. But at this point, they were more than just scavengers content to pick over the bones of our civilization—they were drawn here by the Traveler. In their exodus from Riis, many houses had developed into warbands ruled by despots.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    None were as infamous as the first known Kell of the House of Devils: Akileuks, who had taken the action that led the exodus fleet of the Eliksni on the long drift in the first place. It was he who would plunder what had once been Golden Age London and burn it to the ground before taking his house eastward to the European plains and to the rich hunting grounds of Baikonur.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fallen were not the only warlords to establish themselves in this time either. Having been drawn there by the fall of Nezarec's Pyramid, Hive forces under the banner of Crota would begin to infest the Moon, where they constructed a massive pit. This pit would eventually be turned into a terrifying subterranean fortress with dozens of different offshoots, catacombs, and ritual chambers. We would know it then as the Hellmouth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From here, Crota would create the infrastructure necessary to stage a long-scale Hive invasion of Earth. When the time was right, from this fortress and its attached facilities, Hive Seeder vessels would be launched in the direction of Earth, and thousands upon thousands of Crota's brood would invade.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hellmouth’s construction had been built in a downwards fashion for another reason though: Crota’s forces were intent on reaching the Pyramid of Nezarec. But much as they tried to gain access, they were always denied by the Pyramid itself. And so they collected in its shadow, like a roiling colony of ants, with dreams of stellar conquest and dark gods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crota’s father was not far behind, as many of Oryx’s servants were often found in proximity of those worlds blessed by the Light. As he had done many times before, he quietly established his presences throughout the system, seeding worlds with his forward armies—advanced broods on Earth, the Jovians, the Asteroid Belt, and beyond. They would prepare for the day when Crota’s army was ready, and would bring forth great tribute in the King’s name.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst some intruders were subtle, others were utterly blunt—none more so than the Cabal. Multitudes of scout legions sent by Dominus Ghaul arrived in Sol, including the Sand Eaters, Dust Giants, Siege Dancers, Blind Legion, and Skyburners. Together, they would collectively lay claim to Mars, and spread their forces across its surface to rapidly establish a series of heavily entrenched bases and battle lines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their control over the moon of Phobos was so complete that they were able to establish an entire fleet base there—Fleet Base Korus—a staging ground for the Skyburners and their vessels, and a defensive hub that would coordinate the operations of the Cabal throughout the system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were indications that even these initial scout legions were capable of some terrifying levels of destruction—destruction on a planetary scale. With that in mind, one of their most powerful assets was probably a trio of Psion Flayers that had evolved into their greater forms. This trio, known as the Ice Reapers, was responsible for intelligence gathering and the retrieval of advanced technology, but their psionic powers were also put on display in a most prominent fashion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Flayers began to pull Mars’s moon of Phobos into an unnaturally low orbit, to the point where you could prominently see it in the Martian sky. Supposedly, this was to be used as a weapon of last resort that could be de-orbited from Mars, thus destroying the entire planet if the campaign was going badly. Such force feels excessive, but it is characteristically the Cabal way, and their powerful munitions and strong logistics operation would allow them to contend with the awakening of the oldest beings within Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deep within the cores of many of our planets and moons, lakes of radiolarian fluid began to flow with a renewed purpose. All across the system—from Venus to Mercury to Mars—the Vex began to awaken. The Ishtar Collective had previously discovered them on Venus in the Ishtar Sink, and had determined that their ruins had been there for billions of years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now those ruins began to spring to life, and Vex frames began to emerge to accomplish the inscrutable goals of the Vex. Whilst many worlds were blighted by the Vex, some—such as Mercury—were completely overrun. Mercury’s core was consumed and completely hollowed out to create a giant Vex simulation engine known as the Infinite Forest. The once-lush paradise and breadbasket of the system that Mercury had been was transformed into a blasted wasteland, parked with stony spires and metallic plating of Vex installations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then, at the heart of it all, there was humanity—broken, fractured, surrounded, and desperate. The Collapse had been a body blow to us as a species, but we now faced the grueling task of surviving the hostile system that had once been our dominion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst the whole of humanity was threatened, there was one group who found themselves in an utterly unique situation. On the edges of the system, the Exodus Indigo had landed on Neptune, having been damaged by an attack on their vessel by one of the Disciples of the Witness—or what is presumed to be a Disciple.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Neptune, they were able to use their ship's supplies, including a small amount of SIVA, to establish a basic habitable colony. And then came the remarkable discovery that Savathûn had left for them: the Veil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amongst the number of the Exodus Indigo were the Ishtar Collective researchers Chioma Esi and Maya Sundaresh. They would set about studying the Veil and would eventually find a way to derive power from it, even though it would have many adverse effects on many of the Exo members of their crew.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It didn't take long for the Vex to discover them. And whilst they would be able to push into Neomuna’s outer defenses, they were consistently stopped by the energy emitted by the Veil itself. In response to this, the Vex created a simulation that was woven into Neptune’s electromagnetic field. This hid all in proximity of the Veil—and the Veil itself—thus preventing any humans within that area from being detected by the outside world for a long time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It would also cut them off from any potential reinforcements, but this worked out well for the fledgling colony on Neptune. They were able to hold the Vex at bay and to secure their prosperity in the time being. The screen hiding them from all of the events of the system meant that they were in relative isolation. Thus, with their infrastructure and their defenses starting to be built up, the city of Neomuna was born.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of its earliest residents, a woman named Mikaela Julaha, was exposed to some of the technology that had been brought with them on the Exodus Indigo. In particular, she was exposed to a strange series of nanites from SIVA. The nanites infected her body and violently changed it, forcing her to grow metal plating across parts of her body, giving her remarkable strength and incredible speed, as well as the ability to regenerate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She used this accident to her advantage and became a vicious fighting force against Neomuna’s Vex invaders. Though she would only live for about ten years after the accident, she would be known from then on as the Strider, and her selfless actions were the creation point for the Cloud Strider organization.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As time went on, the establishment of the Cloud Striders became far more entrenched. They had a device that they would eventually use called the Sidereal, and that would allow them to create new Cloud Striders. But given the nature of the experimental technology being used, only two Cloud Striders would be created at a time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the later Cloud Striders, by the callsign of Stargazer, would head out on a mission to Earth in order to make contact with any remnants of humanity that they could find. They had hoped to find segments of human civilization that they could establish diplomatic communications with—perhaps even uplifting them to rejoin humanity on Neomuna.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What they discovered on Earth was anarchy. Earth’s people had not been as fortunate as Neptune’s, and many of them had been eking out a living from what little remained. Worse still were those that had been blessed by the Traveler’s Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In these early Dark Age days, there was little to stop a Lightbearer with a Ghost from being considered a god. Every time someone killed them, they could be brought back from the grave. With their ability to defy death and with the paracausal abilities they had been gifted with their Light, some of them quickly rose to become regional rulers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These were some of the first Warlords—Lightbearers who used their powers to impose their will over others and dominate the world as they saw fit. The Cloud Strider known as Stargazer would encounter a Warlord at some point, and they were followed by a small army numbering in the hundreds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They shot the Warlord and retreated with their team inside a Warmind bunker. Before destroying the bunker to prevent its harmful weapons from getting into the hands of their aggressors, Stargazer petitioned one of Rasputin’s surviving subminds—Malahayati—to delete all references across the Warmind network to Neptune and the Exodus Indigo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would keep the presence of Neomuna truly secure and would make us blissfully unaware of its existence for hundreds of years. When Stargazer returned to Neomuna, they were ready to inform the populace of their findings. And for the longest time, it would be the belief of all Neomuni that Earth was merely a lawless frontier filled with tyrants and warlords, and those trying desperately to survive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the longest time, they would have been right to believe such a thing too. For in the earliest days of the Dark Age, war ravaged the entire system, and nobody was truly safe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Neomuni were not the only ones to note this. The Awoken were keenly aware that the system was treacherous. It was for this reason that Mara Sov sent out her brother, Uldren, to seek a source of power for her that was unique in this system—thus granting her an asymmetric advantage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Uldren scoured the system and returned with a mysterious paracausal creature: a wish dragon. Also known as an Ahamkara, these beasts were shapeshifters capable of completely altering their form. The Ahamkara were also armed with a terrible power—wish magic—a paracausal ability that allowed them to read the desires of their prey and then grant their wishes, whilst also twisting the threads of fate to do so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, in the twisting of such wishes, Faustian bargains would be created. Thus, petitioning a wish dragon for one’s desire was a perilous process requiring great discipline. The creature that Uldren had discovered and presented to Mara called itself Riven, in honor of its new hosts—honoring the twice-Riven Awoken. But it was not alone. Wish dragons populated the system on almost every planet, but were particularly concentrated on Venus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Together, Riven and Mara would set about creating a grand home for the Awoken and the Ahamkara. Mara declared that they would be more than survivors—they would be a people. And thus, through Mara’s vision and Riven’s magic, the Awoken would build a place worthy of their people: the Dreaming City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would not be the Awoken capital, but it would be one of their most holy sites—a place for them to learn, connect with their ancestors, and meditate on the nature of the world. Ahamkara would flock to the Dreaming City, and they would live alongside the Awoken for a time in a mostly peaceful, albeit cautious, symbiosis.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet another secret enclave was constructed in Sol—this time on Earth. There was no place for people to run to, not yet at least. In those early days, refugee caravans trailed across the world, looking for anywhere that they might find some degree of safety. Some would attempt to establish small settlements and towns, like Palamon or Coyote, and whilst these places would be home to some, they were not fated to last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fallen raiders, rogue Lightbearers, and the wilderness of the frontier would be the forces that eventually spelled doom to these settlements. Hope was scarce indeed, but slowly, from the ashes of ruin and death, a spark of hope would be kindled.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, a group of five Warlords set a village to the torch. Another group of Lightbearers made their presence known that day, and at great cost they defeated the would-be tyrants and vowed that there would be no more death. There would be no more without protectors. Humanity needed its protectors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so it was that these first four Lightbearers, present on this day, would become some of humanity’s first great Guardians. Radegast, Perun, Jolder, and Saladin would be counted among the very first of the Iron Lords. In time, it would bring more legendary figures into the fold—Silimar, Gheleon, Skorri, Timur, Efrideet, and Felwinter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And when Felwinter was folded into the Iron Lords, he agreed that they would be able to use his peak. Though he kept the name of Felwinter Peak, from it the Iron Temple was born, and Earth had its first small enclave of relative safety for some. But it would not be the last, and luckily, it would be maintained—even though Silimar had to rebuild it multiple times.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The names of the Iron Lords would be honored within the Iron Temple under an ironwood tree, and those names would stand in legendary regard amongst Guardians even to this day. This was the first knightly order that would bring some semblance of control and peace to the world. They would challenge the Warlords and drive them back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Under the tutelage of the original Iron Lords, many great heroes would be molded into the finest protectors of humanity, one way or another. Not least amongst their number would be an Awoken man of great strength, called Zavala, and a strange human of impatient disposition and great knowledge, called Osiris.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The heroes of Earth had begun to make their mark, but the people of Earth still needed a true place to call home. And the Iron Temple was not large enough for the whole of humanity. For so many, there was but one place they could go—one place more obvious than any other.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They went to that strange place where the Traveler had made its final stand. In the shadow of this broken god, humanity’s remnants would begin to regroup. The refugee camp grew and grew, and eventually, their numbers swelled to the point where everyone needed to be properly organized.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And in this moment, we nearly destroyed ourselves once again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the huddled masses, there were inevitably different perspectives on what had to be done.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “We should make ready to leave Earth for good.”
                    <br>
                    “We should stake our claim and choose strong leaders to guide us.”
                    <br>
                    “We should prepare for war.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each of these different ideas, in turn, attracted more and more people. Eventually, they attracted Lightbearers. And before the camp had even truly been able to establish itself, there were factions within its boundaries. As these factions began to clash, Lightbearer would eventually fight Lightbearer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was in this time that the division within this fledgling refugee camp gave a perfect opportunity for the Fallen to arrive and plunder the great host of human survivors. They did not know the true power of the Guardians on that day, though. And in the face of an external threat, the factions were able to put aside their differences and repel the invaders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These skirmishes were known as the Faction Wars, and they nearly destroyed the only home humanity had on Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A leader would need to step forward. Someone would need to organize them. But it would not take long for the Eliksni to return. This time, though, they would return in strength.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Faction Wars may have been the first time that this new fledgling city had seen battle, but it would not be the last. As more and more Guardians returned, and as more and more walls were erected to defend what was this small refugee encampment, eventually, the House of Devils saw a moment to strike.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be the first great conflict between the Eliksni and humanity on such a scale. And for the Fallen, it was dramatically important. They had seen that the Traveler had settled on Earth. They had seen that it had died for this other people. They had even seen that it had sheltered them beneath its great bulk. And worst of all, it had granted its gift—its blessing—to the various members of that civilization even beyond its own death.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the Fallen, this was not just a religious war. This was their moment to prove that they were still worthy of the Great Machine. And so, the House of Devils descended upon the city in numbers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The defense of the city under this barrage of Fallen artillery was mostly conducted by Guardians. Some rudimentary frames and some members of the civilian population would be armed. In this terrifying fight, this first battle, there would be six different fronts. And the many Guardians that would hold those different fronts would not let even a single one break.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, the battle was known as the Battle of the Six Fronts, and from this moment, the city would truly emerge. It was humanity’s first true victory, and many legendary Guardians—such as Commander Zavala, Saint-14, Lord Shaxx, and Osiris—would emerge as legends on that day, having defended the city with their vicious Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was also in this moment that many other legends were born. A Speaker had come forward—one who could supposedly hear the Traveler’s voice. And what’s more, he had begun to organize the Last City properly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were factions within our ranks, and there were various Lightbearers that needed organizing. It was clear now that the Lightbearers were split across three disciplines: Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks. The Speaker created a Vanguard—a group of three individuals, one representing each discipline.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Titans were heavily clad in the greatest of armor and favored more brutish aspects of martial combat. Their will to charge the enemy was only tempered by their instinct to defend those in need.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hunters were nomadic and free-spirited. They often roamed alone or in small posses, acting as scouts on the wild frontiers of Earth or beyond, or bold adventurers willing to disregard authority and their own safety for a little glimmer and glory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Warlocks quickly became known for their wisdom and sheer arcane power. Of all the different classifications of Lightbearer, their connection to the Traveler was the fiercest, and through that connection, they would unearth grand arcana and forge new techniques of Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These Lightbearers that had defended this encampment would no longer be known as Lightbearers, though. Thanks to their defense of this fledgling city, the Lightbearers had earned themselves a title. It would define them for the rest of their existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They would be known as Guardians. And the first amongst the Vanguard were drawn from their number. Thus, Saint-14, Osiris, and Tallulah Fairwind ascended to be the first-ever mentors of the Vanguard: the Titans, Warlocks, and Hunters respectively.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And as for the factions, they were also looped in. Whilst they had nearly destroyed the Last City during the Faction Wars, they still represented many important perspectives. And so, with them in mind, the Speaker would take a look to see which ones were worth representing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Those that had directly instigated violence were exiled permanently. But those that had not—and those that had peacefully laid down their arms—would be allowed to continue persisting. Of the many that petitioned to be represented more directly, there were three that were most popular: the Concordat, the New Monarchy, and the Dead Orbit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their perspectives would be represented on a Consensus Council. They would be at the heart of government, within the Consensus at large, which was also joined by the Vanguard members and the Speaker.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was also a greater Consensus Council that consisted of any other citizens and other factions within the city. Those such as the Future War Cult or the Symmetry were represented here in addition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was by far the greatest echo of the Battle of the Six Fronts. The union of humanity’s Light-bearing defenders and those who would represent the civilian population into a government was a significant step forward for humanity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it wouldn’t be the only echo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Six Fronts, for which the battle was given its name, were held predominantly by four Titan Orders. As best we know, they were the Pilgrim Guard, the Firebreak Order, the Stoneborn Order, and the First Pillars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless of which of these Orders were present on that day, we do know that the defense of this fledgling city on six fronts by four Orders of Titans is the reason for Titan heraldry being what it is: a hexagon of six sides with four different divided pieces to it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their heraldry has always remembered Six Fronts. It is one of their proudest achievements—to defend the Last City without a single one of these fronts breaking.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And as it began to grow, this fledgling city that had once been nothing but a refugee camp simply became known as the Last City: the last safe haven for humanity in Sol, as best we knew at the time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst there were some amongst the Titan Orders who lamented the way that Six Fronts ended—in particular the Firebreak, who wished that they could have had their glorious charge into the ranks of the retreating Fallen—there were many other dangers throughout the system. Soon, the Guardians would be rallied to deal with them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In particular, securing the city’s defenses would allow us to turn our eyes to the rest of the system. If there were terrible things happening on Venus—in particular, the Ahamkara starting to transform it—we didn’t understand why at the time. But it is likely that this was thanks to the intervention of the Nine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And from what we had seen, we had realized the power of these terrible beasts was a threat that we could not allow to exist. And so the order was given: the Guardians would hunt down the Ahamkara and bring about their extinction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was not an easy choice to make. Guardians had gained power from their bargains. But much had also been lost, and Ahamkara bargains were notoriously Faustian. The Ahamkara would be hunted down and made extinct. The terrible weight of this decision would be a stain upon Guardian history for all our days.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, though, we weren’t truly efficient. For all the Guardians that did hunt down dragons, there would be many that didn’t return. And there were rumors that some escaped the hunt—though the Cryptarchy mostly dismissed this as nothing but superstition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Guardians never found Riven. Mara Sov had hidden her away in the Dreaming City, and at long last, she had found her unique source of power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was not the only tragedy that would befall the Lightbearers in the Dark Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As what one might consider to be the Dark Age drew to a close, the Iron Lords were making significant progress in cutting down their Warlord aggressors. Earth was starting to fall under one banner where human territory was concerned, and the Iron Lords were doing a decent job at uniting humanity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then, they discovered something.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Iron Lord Warlock known as Felwinter was searching relentlessly for SIVA alongside Lord Timur. The nanotechnology that was meant to all but guarantee the self-sufficiency of humanity would be a grand prize. In fact, for many of the Iron Lords, it would be an obsession.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, Felwinter discovered where to find it. And he also discovered something about himself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He learned that he was a Siddhartha Golem—an Exo risen to be Rasputin’s eyes and ears within humanity. Effectively, a spy, but more accurately, someone who would be able to keep tabs on human civilization and allow Rasputin to learn from them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But when Felwinter was destroyed and then risen again as a Lightbearer, what little of Rasputin that remained on Earth was incensed and enraged. Continuously, Felwinter would be the target of orbital strikes and strange attacks from any Warmind installation he went near.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Felwinter was, in many cases, like a son to Rasputin. And what little of him had recognized Felwinter in that moment was jealous of the Traveler for having stolen his son—or what he would think of as his son. And like so many jealous fathers, Rasputin would seek to punish his offspring.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, with much work and dedication, Felwinter would discover that there was a production site for SIVA nanites in the eastern section of the Cosmodrome. This was what the Iron Lords had been looking for. It represented a way to lift the people of humanity out of squalor and to return us to the Golden Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Iron Lords descended upon the Cosmodrome in force at the order of their leader—but first amongst equals—Lord Radegast. More than a hundred Iron Lords descended upon the Cosmodrome. But what they found that day was not SIVA as a tool, but SIVA as a plague.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SIVA had been given orders upon noticing the intrusion and presence of Felwinter. These orders came from the remnant of Rasputin that controlled it. It was a series of orders contained in only three words—three words that Rasputin would live to learn and regret until the end of his life:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Replicate. Eliminate. Immunize.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The nanites were unleashed as weapons. And there was nothing that the Iron Lords could do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over a hundred Iron Lords descended into that place, which would one day be called the Plaguelands. Of those hundred or so that entered, there would be only two survivors that day: Lord Saladin Forge and Lady Efrideet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SIVA production was momentarily stopped. The Iron Lord Jolder had taken an explosive device deep into the SIVA replication complex, and she had managed to detonate it just as everyone was being consumed by the nanites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But even in their failure, the legend of the Iron Lords lived on—partly as a cautionary tale, and partially as a heroic one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And they were not alone. The Last City might have been built on the greatest tragedy of humankind, but from its humble beginnings, legends would rise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with them, there would be a chance for humanity to prosper once again.
