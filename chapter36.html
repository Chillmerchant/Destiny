                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Before humanity could pursue the Witness through its mysterious portal, Titan returned from the depths of the unknown—along with a distress call from Deputy Commander Sloane. Found alive but tainted by Taken corruption, Sloane had forged a psychic bond with Ahsa, the last uncorrupted Leviathan of Fundament, who revealed the tragic origins of the Witness and the key to its defeat. Yet as Xivu Arath’s Hive waged war beneath Titan’s methane seas and the Lucent Brood sought to resurrect Oryx as a Lightbearer, the Guardians uncovered how perilously close the system stood to annihilation. In the end, only one truth remained: to follow the Witness into the Traveler and preserve all creation, they would have to resurrect the Witch Queen, Savathûn.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Before we made our way to Titan—before it had even been returned to us—we attempted the most obvious course of action. A portal, an entrance into the site of the Traveler, had been carved by the Witness. We had to see if we could follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We sent an exploratory ship to pursue the Witness’s wake. The Guardian aboard, Joxer, was later found within what remained of the ship’s wreckage. He had been cosmically shifted—phased into the hull of the vessel before it had been spat out of the portal, as though he had been moved and reassembled on a quantum level, fused into the ship itself. We would need to find a way to guarantee our safe passage; entering the portal in this state was a fool’s gambit doomed to failure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Luckily for us, our first clue would present itself in due time. Titan re-emerged from the dimension to which the Witness had abducted it, and immediately we began receiving an emergency distress signal from an all-too-familiar voice—Deputy Commander Sloane. She was alive. She had survived all these years in isolation, and she was now calling for help.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala immediately sent a contingent of Titan forces, including Saint-14 and Lord Saladin, to find her. We were also deployed as part of the recovery force, and the Drifter decided to tag along—supposedly more out of curiosity than anything else. Realistically, by this point his involvement in our plans was of his own volition. He knew that Zavala could grow reckless, and so the Drifter sought to use his years of adventuring experience to temper Zavala’s ambition with a little practical wisdom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we touched down on Titan, it was clear that something wasn’t right. A remnant force of Hive appeared to still occupy the Arcology. That in itself wasn’t unusual—but these forces belonged to the Hive God of War, Xivu Arath.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After our initial assaults began, we were greeted by a terrifying sound, unlike anything we had ever heard before. Xivu’s voice echoed through our minds, amplifying the ferocity of her forces and weakening our resolve. She enraged and taunted Saint for his failure to prevent Sagira’s death—for not being at his partner’s side to defend him from her High Celebrant. His rage was palpable, but aside from breaking the advancing Hive upon his gauntlet and faceplate, there was little he could do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we stopped Xivu’s rituals and interference, we noticed that the signal of Sloane’s distress call was not coming from somewhere on the Arcology platforms, but instead from deep beneath the waves. Zavala immediately tried to get us to jump into the ocean in the most direct fashion possible, but the Drifter had a better idea.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He transported us to his ship, knowing we didn’t have the equipment to survive the crushing pressure of Titan’s oceans. Once properly outfitted, we descended through the methane seas and found our way to a submerged dive tank—a research center from the Golden Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There, we found Sloane. She had been infused with Taken corruption. Her mind was still her own, but the corruption allowed her to tune into the commands of Xivu Arath. It was not a gift she had chosen—it was an affliction. She could still hear Xivu’s whispers in her mind, and the strain of her long campaign was clear from the start.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sloane was strong—stronger than perhaps a thousand other Titans—but the burden she bore was monumental, greater than any Guardian’s at that time. It is hard to resist the strength of a god, let alone Xivu Arath, when one stands alone. But luckily for Sloane, in her years of isolation on Titan, she might have been the only Guardian, but she wasn’t truly alone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside her Ghost, she had made another ally. From behind the viewport of the dive pod, a giant creature swam into view, pressing its massive eye against the porthole for all to see. Sloane had found a survivor of a primordial species—the last of the original Worm Gods, one uncorrupted by the Witness. It was not a worm at all, but a whale of the great oceans of Fundament. She had found the one who had escaped the Witness’s corruption and now sought its downfall, just as we did.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was the legendary Leviathan of Titan—the monster behind the glass. As the Drifter called it, “the long boy in the soup.” Her name was Ahsa. Sloane had been saved from Xivu’s clutches by this Great Leviathan, who promised her aid in the battles ahead. That assistance included Ahsa’s intimate knowledge of the Witness’s origins.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to access this information, the link that Ahsa had forged between her mind and Sloane’s needed to be reinforced. To do this, we would use one of the Witness’s own tools against it—Egregore. The fungus we had found aboard the Leviathan had also infested Titan’s seas, growing like coral in the deepest trenches. Egregore spores open the mind to Darkness and enable psychic connections that would otherwise shatter under the strain of a waking mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ahsa and Sloane used this coral to strengthen their bond and allow a deeper communion. After enough infusions, Ahsa was able to fully communicate with us through Sloane.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She told us of the Witness’s origins—of how the Precursor people had once enjoyed the Traveler’s bounty, of how they had sought to merge it with the Veil to create the Final Shape, and of how the Traveler had rejected the synthesis and fled. It was also here that we learned of the terrible cost the Precursors paid to create the Witness—merging their minds into a single compound being through the power of Darkness learned from the Veil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was how the Witness was born. And Ahsa promised that soon she would tell us of one who knew how to defeat it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Titan’s return to the system brought far more than our discoveries. The Lucent Brood were on the move again. Shortly after Titan’s return, a massive Lucent Hive vessel crashed into the methane seas and sank beneath the waves. This was no accident—it was deliberate. It had been sunk to a specific location near the bottom of the ocean, close to the New Pacific Arcology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Lucent Hive secured the platform above with a small army. The Hive stationed there were enacting a ritual to cloak the entrance to the Arcology’s drilling platform—the one area we could use to access the seabed and enter the vessel ourselves. Sloane sent us to investigate and put an end to the ritual.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We stopped their ritual of concealment, but it was clear that the Lucent Hive’s true objective lay on the seabed. Accessing the drilling platform, we dove into darkness. The only viable way to reach the seafloor was to follow the Arcology down, and so we did—marching across the dark ocean floor of Titan toward the crashed vessel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Lucent Hive there hailed from various broods, most notably those of the Taken King Oryx and his banished son, Nokris. Something nefarious was taking place. After defeating the newly risen Ecthar, the Sword of Oryx—now Shield of Savathûn—we pressed deeper into the lowest reaches of the ship until we reached the seabed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There we discovered the Lucent Hive’s objective: a body, gargantuan in size, bearing a face all too familiar—one that had once spelled doom for the system. It was Oryx.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His body had been pulled from its low orbit of Saturn into the gravitational anomaly when Titan was abducted. It had fallen into Titan’s atmosphere, crashing into the seas, where it now rested upon the ocean floor. The Lucent Hive had discovered the King’s remains, and their plan was simple—but if it succeeded, it would change the nature of the system forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using a combination of the Light and Nokris’s necromantic powers, the Lucent Hive sought to raise one of humanity’s most ancient foes as a Lucent Hive. A Lightbearer with Oryx’s power would be nearly unstoppable—a Taken King reborn in the sheen of the Light, a force beyond reckoning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The danger was immediate and undeniable. Without hesitation, we crushed the Ghost being used in the ritual and engaged the Lucent Hive wizard at its heart. In her former life, this wizard had been one of Nokris’s high necromancers. Perhaps the plan had been hers—or a remnant of her old craft—but it would not come to fruition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We stopped the ritual just in time. Yet this moment reminded us of the danger posed by Savathûn’s brood. Even as the end of all things loomed, they continued to weave their schemes—plots that could unmake the fragile structure of the universe to their advantage. We would need to keep a closer watch on them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we prepared to commune with Ahsa one last time, Xivu Arath struck again. She had abducted Ahsa, and her wizards dragged her into the deep. In a dark ritual chamber, deeper than any we had ventured, we had to find Ahsa before the ritual was complete.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we arrived, we realized Xivu’s plan. Given enough time and focus, her wizards would corrupt Ahsa—and if they succeeded, our one chance to learn how to defeat the Witness would be lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We descended into the ritual, slaughtered Xivu’s wizards, and rescued Ahsa just in time. Returning her to the dive tank, however, Sloane’s burden of corruption overwhelmed her, and she spoke with the voice of the Hive God of War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Xivu Arath mocked Sloane for her weakness, proclaiming that without war, Sloane was nothing. Sloane even raised her blade to Commander Zavala’s throat and nearly struck—but Zavala, calm and resolute, spoke not as a commander but as a friend. His voice steadied her. His conviction cut through Xivu’s influence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sloane wasn’t alone. She never had been. The corruption faded, and another voice emerged through her lips—the voice of Ahsa. She was free once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ahsa conveyed a vital truth through Sloane: the one who hides truth in deception knew the way. To follow the Witness into the Traveler, we would need to resurrect Savathûn once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Witch Queen had to return, or all life in the universe would be lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The mere suggestion of this enraged Saladin and Saint-14. Both had fought long and hard against her influence, and Saint in particular was furious over what Savathûn had done to Osiris. But we had no choice. To prevent the end of all things, we would need to bring her back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hidden still held Savathûn’s remains in a secure vault. They had been studied by Eris Morn and were mostly inert—but they could be resurrected at any time. All they needed was Immaru, her Ghost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He would be the next to lead us forward. And it would be a dark path indeed.
