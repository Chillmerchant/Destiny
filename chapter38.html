                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In their pursuit of the elusive Fifteenth Wish, the Guardians and Mara Sov venture once more into the Dreaming City, seeking to harness the lingering power of Riven, the last Ahamkara. To grant the wish that could open a path into the Pale Heart, Riven demands a price—the rebirth of her extinct kind. Their quest to recover her scattered eggs reveals Taranis, Riven’s fallen mate, whose final selfless wish preserved their clutch for this destined moment. As Crow steps forward to fulfill his fate, forging a link between the Traveler and the Veil, the Guardians wage war against the Sol Divisive to reopen the way. When the path is finally secured, Crow enters the Pale Heart—only to find himself face to face with Cayde-6—and the saga culminates in the reminder that Guardians are the makers of their own destiny.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Ahamkara are strange beings indeed. They can be killed, but even in death, they are able to manifest their powers of wish magic. From something as small as a shard of bone, one can make a wish that will spell disaster or change fate irrevocably.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeing Riven's clutch, knowing that her remains still lay in the Dreaming City, and knowing that the Techeuns had secured her heart, we knew where we had to go next. After hearing the news of our plan, the Awoken Corsairs mobilized with all haste. It was perhaps not surprising that if we were going to deal with Riven, we would need to use the Wishing Wall. Mara had constructed it long ago to deal with Riven in a more controlled manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But even in death, the Wishing Wall still held power, and Riven would be able to grant wishes to those who used it properly. This was how we would input the Fifteenth Wish, and even though Riven was dead, she would still be able to grant one last wish. That being said, we would need some of her remains to power the process properly, and so we descended upon the Queenswalk where we had killed Riven years earlier.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite the interception of the Vex of the Sol Divisive, we managed to secure one of Riven's teeth. Taking this to the Wishing Wall, we were able to invoke the power of the long-dead dragon. Rumors had long swirled of the long-lost Fifteenth Wish that we would cherish, but it had not been found—until now.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we approached to make this wish upon the Wishing Wall, Riven refused to grant it. Mara and Riven would have stern words. The two Great Beings of Power spoke once more, with her Techeuns focusing Riven's spirit within the heart they had contained. Thus, a great manifestation of Riven's spirit—as large as her original size—appeared before Mara and spoke with the Queen of the Reef.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They bargained once again, as they had done when they created the Dreaming City. But this time, all of creation hung in the balance. As the price of granting Savathûn's wish, Riven demanded that we gather her remaining eggs and give them a chance at life. This would mean the return of a species that the Guardians had put to the torch and driven to extinction. It would mean the return of the Ahamkara and their potentially dangerous wish magic to the system and beyond. It would change everything in ways unforeseen, but the alternative was oblivion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had no choice, and so we accepted Riven's bargain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Riven had hidden the remnants of her clutch within her lair—a space within the Ascendant Realm and the Ley Lines that was also attached to the Dreaming City, one we would have to enter via the city's portals. But something had happened. When we arrived at the heart of Riven's lair, it turned out that her eggs had been scattered across the Ley Lines. All seven of them were missing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it wasn't the Witness or Mara Sov who had done this. There was another force at play. We would discover who it was when we pursued the Vex of the Sol Divisive. They had stolen one of Riven's eggs and managed to transport it into their own domain—the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we approached the egg's location, it was clear that Riven had been here long before. Paracausal echoes of where she had been lingered. But strangely enough, there were other echoes as well—echoes from another wish dragon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we reached the site, we found the egg unharmed. And it was next to something that perhaps one of us did expect—Riven perhaps hoped against all hope. Lying there beside the egg were the remains of another Ahamkara, one she had known well. The bones reached out to Crow and petitioned him, wishing to use him to give voice to their words. And he obliged.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus we heard the words of the Ahamkara known as Taranis—Riven's mate. He had been the one to scatter the eggs, but he was not an aggressor. He was, in truth, their savior. He had kept himself hidden in the Black Garden, where his lair was located, long after he and Riven had made their clutch. They had both managed to survive and were still communicating—quietly whispering in the spaces between realities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But when Riven was taken by Oryx, Taranis knew that their clutch was in danger of falling to corruption. They too might be lost, and the future of their entire species would be in jeopardy. Out of love for Riven and for their unborn children, Taranis did the one thing no Ahamkara must do—he fed on his own desire and granted his own wish. A wish to keep his and Riven's clutch safe until a Wishkeeper could come along to reunite them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would be that Wishkeeper.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the death of Taranis was the price of this wish. Ahamkara must never grant their own wishes, for it forces their desires to feed upon their own existence. By granting his own wish, Taranis forfeited his life. Yet he was unlike other Ahamkara. Unlike his brethren, he did not twist the wishes of his petitioners. His way was different—a path the Ahamkara could follow to exist in harmony. His lessons for Riven and their children would hopefully echo into the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His kind-hearted nature was a novelty among his kin, but it didn’t have to be. Future generations, if properly stewarded by Mara Sov and the Awoken, could learn to follow Taranis’s way instead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we progressed to discover more of Riven's eggs, she came forward to us with an admission of truth. Her bargain with Savathûn—the Fifteenth Wish—would only transport a single person into the Pale Heart. If we were to take this wish and go as that singular person, we would have to face the Witness alone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In light of this realization, many difficult decisions had to be made. But it was Crow who would ultimately rise to the occasion. He and Mara still shared their cosmic link, even though he had died and been reborn as a Guardian. That link connected them, even if one stepped into another dimension. Crow realized that he could step into the Pale Heart of the Traveler, and Mara would still be able to find him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using their link and the entangled properties of the Veil and the Traveler, Crow and Mara's bond could be used by Osiris, who would coordinate it with the signal of the Veil and the Traveler, thus creating a safe passage into the Pale Heart that the rest of us would follow. However, Crow would have to go first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara didn't initially approve of the idea, but she knew that a part of her relationship with her reborn brother could only be mended if she allowed him the freedom to choose his own path and be the arbiter of his own fate. And so, Mara did the most difficult thing she had ever been asked to do—she relinquished her control and agreed to Crow's plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we located Riven's final egg, it was initially stolen away by the Scorn. However, these Scorn were not under the control of the Witness. Instead, they had flown under the banner of an old and eternal foe—Fikrul, the Fanatic. He had directed his Scorn to acquire the egg, and with their own uncontrolled desires, the Scorn might have fed the young Ahamkara if they weren't careful, leading to potential disaster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Fikrul's forces were no match for us, and we recovered the final egg—though Fikrul's presence was a dire omen for the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At last, Riven agreed and decided to grant the Fifteenth Wish. It would consume the rest of her energy, meaning she would no longer be able to manifest as a spirit. This was perhaps the last time she would commune with us, but she was ready for what came next, and the future of her brood had been secured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So she granted the Fifteenth Wish and summoned forth a passageway into the heart of the Traveler. Crow passed through, and Mara could sense that he was indeed on his way. Riven, having played her part, folded back into the whispered edges of reality—her work now complete, and her true last wish finally granted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It would take Crow months to pass into the Pale Heart, and Osiris months to prepare the Veil for the connection. But we would spend our time wisely. Guardians rearmed and prepared to venture into the Pale Heart in force. Venturing into the Light like this would require new arms, and so Lord Shaxx released an arsenal of new tools for us to make use of—old weapons as well, from our distant past, that had once been terrors within his Crucible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Guardians held the forces of the Witness at bay as their onslaught flooded across Earth in unending waves, and we gathered as much power as we could.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At last, the day came. Osiris made contact, telling us there was interference between the signal of the Veil and the Traveler. Perhaps this was one final attempt by the forces of the Witness to prevent Crow from accessing the Pale Heart. The source of the interference originated from an all-too-familiar place—the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clearly, our oldest foes, the Vex of the Sol Divisive, were up to their old games. Using Riven's secret pathway from the Dreaming City into the Black Garden, we stormed their territory and found ourselves facing a familiar sight: a circular doorway opening in segments, revealing a monstrous thing festering once more. The Sol Divisive had created another heart of the Black Garden—another flawed copy of the Veil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This had been done with the assistance of the Witness, and its purpose was now clear. If left to their own devices, the Vex might have been able to use this heart to supersede the Veil's signal and lock us out of the Pale Heart of the Traveler for good.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But for all their predictive power, these Vex did not foresee that we would return to the site of our first conquest ten years later. Where before we had conquered the Black Garden as novices, now we returned as Godslayers. The Sol Divisive were defeated, and once again, the heart was banished. The pathway to the Veil was complete.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the interference died down, at long last Crow was ejected on the other side of the portal and fell into the strange land of the Traveler's Pale Heart. Almost immediately upon landing, he came under fire from a stranger on the ridge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But this stranger bore an all-too-familiar face. Whether because of wish magic, the Light of the Traveler, or some other strange circumstance, Crow found himself flat on his back, facing a gunslinger holding the Ace of Spades—Cayde-6.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If it wasn’t for Glint’s quick appearance, and the realization that Crow wasn’t Uldren, Cayde might have ended him there. But they were quick to recognize the truth and stood side by side before the festering evil the Witness was creating in the Pale Heart—an evil almost ready to fulfill its purpose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For now, the time of endings is upon us. Whether the sun rises again on a world free of the Witness, or whether it sets eternally and rests within the Final Shape, know this: of the many thousands of lessons taught to us over these last ten years—lessons hard-earned through victory and failure—one has stood the test of time above all others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And it is simply this: Guardians make their own fate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you step into the Pale Heart of the Traveler and confront the Witness, remember—you are the arbiter of your own future, and by no will but your own can you be deterred. You are no mere instrument of the Light. You are no mere tool of the Dark. You have transcended your purpose and become something more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You are the one who moves time forward. You are the architect of the future. You are the reason for victory on the horizon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so go forth, and do as a Guardian does—for you are no mere protector. You are the wild growth of the Garden’s heart. You are the battle that makes waves eternal. You are the prime mover of your own prophecies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because you—you are Destiny.
