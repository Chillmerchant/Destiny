                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    The Hive's history is built on a lie told by the Witness to Sathona, now Savathûn, leading her and her siblings, Oryx and Xivu Arath, to embrace the Sword Logic and the Worm Gods of Fundament. They became nearly invincible, creating throne worlds and spreading destruction across the universe. Their greatest foe was the Ecumene, but Oryx ultimately gained immense power by killing his siblings and a Worm God. Oryx, the Taken King, wielded the Taken army to continue his conquest, even manipulating his children like Crota and Nokris to expand his reach. Despite divisions among the Hive gods, Oryx’s legacy of devastation, along with the Hive’s allegiance to the Witness, continued to wreak havoc, including on the Eliksni homeworld, Riis.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> The tale of the Hive is one filled with lies, built upon a lie told long ago by the Witness to Sathona, now Savathûn, the Witch Queen. Predominantly, though, we have but a single perspective to judge the millions of years' worth of Hive history by—the perspective of Auryx, who would one day become Oryx, the Taken King. He recorded his version of events of the Hive’s history, and we have seen it in a series of calcified fragments. We would one day know the knowledge contained in these fragments by a different name: the Books of Sorrow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These books may not be completely trustworthy, especially because they say nothing of Rhulk, the Witness, or the great lie that turned Sathona’s mind to the Deep and wrought the young Krill siblings to the Worm Gods of Fundament, but they are our best and only record of the Hive’s history—a history that is theirs to tell, as they were so often the victors. Hundreds of civilizations were snuffed out by the advancing armadas, the swarms of the Hive. Through their slaughter and through the Sword Logic, Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath would create throne worlds: cysts in reality, pocket dimensions that defied the laws of the universe, nestled within the Ascendant Plane. Upon their deaths, the newly ascended Hive gods would be reborn in these throne worlds, and only within these throne worlds could they ever truly be killed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, even in the face of fierce resistance, the three ruling siblings of the Hive—and all those that would follow as Ascendants thereafter—would hold enough power to be nearly unassailable. They would be a scourge upon the universe, and for a time, they looked invincible. That was until they faced the Ecumene, a starfaring empire made seemingly of a conglomeration of many races, one that might have some dark power of their own, though this is hard to confirm as it is only spoken of in whispers: of lore recovered from the Black Pyramids.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks to the information obtained from the Witness’s own Pyramid vessel, we know that the Ecumene had built a unity of minds, a chorus constructed from the powers of Darkness but not one of evil—one of harmonious thought. Together, the Ecumene were more than the Hive had ever faced. They also had a helping hand—a Krill matriarch called Taox. She had been the original traitor who schemed to depose their father, the old Osmium King. She had been unable to kill those three siblings, and when they had been reborn into the Hive gods, she fled the surface of Fundament, toward the Ammonite, and eventually toward deep space. She would find her way out into the reaches of the void and would be picked up by the Ecumene’s forces. She gave them practically all the intelligence they would need to break the Hive’s offensive, and break it the Ecumene did. Their great fleets pushed the Hive back time after time, and they targeted and overkilled Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath wherever they appeared on the battlefield.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In time, they might have been successful and might have wiped one of the Witness’s useful tools from the surface of the universe, but this success would prove to be fleeting at best. Convening within Oryx’s throne world, the Hive gods discussed how to defeat the Ecumene. This discussion led to a simple conclusion: one should claim the powers of the others. Thus, Oryx killed Xivu Arath and Savathûn, claiming their power by the logic of the sword. He used this power to confront one of his own gods, Akka, the Worm of Secrets, whom he killed in the name of knowledge. With this, Oryx learned the secret of communing with what he termed to be the Deep.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is presumed that this led to the first meeting between Oryx and the Witness, although in truth, it isn’t clear who Oryx spoke to. There is a difference discernible to those that read the Books of Sorrow; an inconsistency between the approach of the Witness and the approach of whatever being spoke to Oryx in the Darkness. What is known is that Oryx emerged empowered. He had a command of powers beyond the comprehension of the Ecumene. Oryx was no more; he had returned as Oryx, the Taken King, and he had learned the power to abduct beings through portals into another place where his enemies would be hollowed out by malicious forces and would be returned to the battlefield as thralls under Oryx’s command. These were the first Taken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And though Oryx would be called the Taken King, there would be many who would come to wield them in time: the Witness, Rhulk, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath. Seemingly, the only requirement to wield the Taken was a strong enough will to impose upon them, for the Taken are but husks, free of meaning and purpose until one is indwelled within them by a greater force. Thus, Oryx commanded them. He would unleash the Taken upon the Ecumene, and his campaign conjured back his siblings by embodying their different penchants. Where he was one of slaughter and war, he would summon back Xivu Arath, and in the Ecumene’s last moments where he tricked them into a fool’s gambit, he would embody his sister Savathûn. Thus, all three Hive gods were returned, and with newfound powers, Oryx would go on to conquer more worlds and would raise four wicked offspring: Crota, the Light-Eater; Ir Halak, the Unraveler; Ir Anûk, the Weaver; and Nokris, whose name would be struck from the World’s Grave and who would one day come to be known as a heretic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through his children, Oryx would extend his own power as all his children would tithe destruction to him, but they would be storied villains unto themselves. Ir Anûk and Ir Halak were the fabled creators of the Oversoul and the Deathsong, destructive tools within the Hive’s arsenal that are still in use to this day. It was Oryx’s sons, though, that would be the most storied, albeit not for reasons one might define as productive. Nokris, who was weak of body but strong of mind, sought out hidden apocrypha that might grant him forgotten power. This led him to the Worm Gods, and in particular, Xol, who was weaker than his siblings and sought an alliance for the sake of his own survival. Xol promised Nokris a power that was forbidden to the Hive in exchange for loyalty, servitude, and his very heart. The power that Xol gifted Nokris was necromancy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One must understand: though death is the realm of the Hive, necromancy is a power that is beyond offensive to them. Death to the Hive is a sacred thing, indicative of one’s place in the universe, of one’s standing before the final perfect shape. Life is for the living, for the strong, and death is the fate of all those that are not strong enough to continue existing. To return a being to life after its true and final death was seen as a great heresy. This was not the same as the return of Savathûn or Xivu Arath, who fed upon the bounties of trickery and war that Oryx had conjured. This was not the return of any Ascendant who had tricked death and become strong enough to defy the laws of causality and build their own throne world. This was an abomination. The weak had been given a second chance. It was unacceptable. For this crime, Nokris was banished, and all memory of him was stripped from the great archives of the Hive known as the World’s Grave. All record of him was destroyed; all trace of his story, wiped clean. Only one statue, obstinate in its permanence, was left standing near the altar of Oryx.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the trace of Oryx’s second son, aside from this, would all be gone. Nokris would live on past his banishment, and his chronicles would be told when we returned one day to Mars, but not before. Of Oryx’s first son, though, there would still be many chronicles. One day, as Crota was attempting to learn alongside his two sisters, he would unwittingly be tricked by Savathûn and would allow the Vex to invade his father’s throne world. A Vex Mind by the name of Quria would arrive to learn from the battle, and quickly observing the Hive, it deduced that within Oryx’s domain, it was the Sword Logic and veneration of it that made one truly powerful. Thus, it established a foothold in the heart of the Hive’s power by killing the Hive themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It had established itself within Oryx’s throne by Oryx’s own laws, but it was still a causal being, as all the Vex are, and when Oryx returned and blunted the offensive, it was Crota who would bear the blame. He took Crota and flung him into the Vex Gate Network, saying, “Come home glorious, or die forgotten,” and to these words, Crota would hold. He would become a legendary demon and would lead his brood to slaughter countless worlds in his father’s name, dedicating secret temples to him and learning much of the brutality that his father would impose upon the world, venerating it in time. But Crota’s actions had exposed the weakness in Oryx’s own throne world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In response, Oryx decided that the solution would be to combine his pocket dimension with a massive Hive vessel in real space. Thus, Oryx took the corpse of the Worm God Akka and used its hide to create the baleful armoring that would encapsulate his throne world: the Dreadnaught—a massive vessel whose construction was technically a paradox. When Oryx placed his throne world into the Dreadnaught, it overlapped an Ascendant Plane pocket with real space. This place should not exist, but the power of Oryx was so great that he could indeed create a paradox that would be his great fortress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oryx would then vengefully hunt down all those that were an affront to him and would eventually find the Vex Mind that had invaded his throne world. When Quria, Blade Transform, fought Oryx, it stood no chance. He took it and would eventually gift its Taken remnants to Savathûn. In this moment, Oryx should have been truly ascendant, for as he had invaded and found the Vex, it was amongst the fleet of the Harmony—the next who had been blessed by the Traveler’s Light. It had lied to their worlds, and now they stood within the gravity of a singularity, except it had been paused, and the worlds were living in a flourishing Light. The Hive had found these worlds and were soon to tear them down root and stem.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hive had become so powerful, Oryx in particular, that he would constrain the growth of all other things in the universe, including Savathûn and Xivu Arath. And so, the three divided. Before, as a united force, they could have stood and destroyed the whole universe, but Savathûn and Xivu Arath took their broods and became distant, needing space to grow and change into something more powerful. Thus, Oryx was alone, and his sisters were split from him. His swarm had made an indelible mark on the universe and had helped to serve the Witness’s purpose. They had pursued the Traveler and destroyed those that stood in the Witness’s path. But now Oryx was alone. Now all the Hive gods were alone. In this, they had shown their one possible weakness. But to the Witness itself, this was of little concern.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hive were nothing but tools, after all, and they knew little of the true nature of the Final Shape as the Witness devised it. But they would soon serve a purpose in fulfilling its completion. It was in this way that the Hive and the Taken King would descend upon a distant world belonging to an alien people. A peaceful planet of artisans, weavers, dancers, and technologically inclined priests. It was here that they found the Eliksni and their homeworld of Riis, and like a great storm, they would ravage this place, and the Traveler would once again be forced to flee.
