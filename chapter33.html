                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After Eramis is freed by the Witness and ordered to recover ancient Eliksni relics tied to Nezarec, the Guardians, alongside Drifter, Spider, Mithrax, and his daughter Eido, race to stop her. As the hunt unfolds, buried truths emerge—Mithrax’s mother once desecrated Nezarec’s body, and Mithrax himself had wielded a fragment of that dark power as a ruthless pirate lord. This revelation fractures his bond with Eido, but when Eramis defends her from the Lucent Hive, the cycle of vengeance breaks. With the relics secured, Mithrax redeems his past by purifying their darkness to awaken Osiris, setting the stage for a new chapter in humanity’s fight—and for the rise of Rasputin one final time.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> After the nightmares of the Leviathan had been quelled, a surge of activity began on Europa. Eramis had been released from her icy tomb by the Witness. It had demanded a task of her and expected success without delay. It was her Dark Master now. The freedom that she had sought for the House of Salvation was nothing but an illusion. She would be forced to rally her forces in the Witness’s name. And now, she would serve its dark purpose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It showed her a series of relics—relics that Eramis recognized. Many had been claimed in the past by the Eliksni during the great days of the pirate crews. Her task was simple: collect them. The punishment for failure would be severe. Eramis rose to her feet and reunited with some of her oldest allies—her pirating crews. The old Eliksni pirate legends of the system would flock to her cause. The ship stealer was on the move once again. And as both Ship Stealer of the Devils and Kell of Salvation, she would find these relics for the Witness. The hunt was on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But for us, this hunt began with a favor for the Drifter. Eramis’s pirates had intercepted one of his shipments, and the Drifter had asked us to kindly retrieve it. As it turned out, it was the Spider, holed up in a containment pod. The Spider had decided in recent years that it was time to go to ground—especially considering that Mara Sov did not take kindly to the way he had treated Crow during his time of occupation with the Spider. And so, in order to avoid Mara’s wrath, Drifter and the Spider had cut a deal. The Drifter would smuggle him out, and the Spider just needed to sit tight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, the Spider told us that if we were to get him out, we would need to commandeer his old ketch and exfiltrate him. He had overheard a few of House Salvation’s dregs talking about the new goal that the house had been set by their Kell. Now we knew that we needed to search for these artifacts in order to keep them out of Eramis’s hands. Riding out on the ketch, we returned to the Last City with our crew. The Spider would now be under the protection of the House of Light, answering to his new Kell, Mithrax—whom he seemed to have a strange degree of familiarity with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, the Spider, Drifter, and ourselves united alongside Eido and Mithrax. Together, this motley crew of Lightbearers and Eliksni would search for the relics and attempt to secure them for the Coalition. Eido was a relatively new arrival in our eyes. We had briefly spoken with her during the time of the Endless Night, but now we would meet Mithrax’s adopted daughter firsthand. She was more than simply Mithrax’s daughter, though—she was the Scribe of the House of Light, and a competent one at that. Her curiosity was something that would consistently guide her on expeditions, and while it would sometimes put her in danger, it was also an incredible boon, allowing her to uncover secrets that few others had ever thought possible. She would be responsible for researching the nature of the relics we were trying to uncover.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mithrax was uneasy being around these old crews, and he was equally uneasy being around the relics we were collecting. There was indeed a terrible darkness to these relics, but there was something more to Mithrax’s fear—familiarity. It was clear that Mithrax had interacted with these relics at some point in his past, but the true nature of his connection to them wouldn’t be revealed to us just yet. The relics were scattered across the system, but each contained a dark power that made them valuable items to possess. They had universally fallen into the hands of various pirate warlords and smugglers, and we consistently raced Eramis to each one when they were located, often beating her to the punch by only a matter of moments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gathering more and more of these relics to our side only made Mithrax increasingly uneasy. Eventually, Eido’s curiosity was piqued by a transmission from Eramis. She made contact with Eido and Mithrax and demanded to parley with us on neutral ground. She made this request in keeping with old Eliksni customs. Her honor was at stake should she break the contract, and so all approached with the idea of peace and parley in mind. But the words that Eramis spoke would be her true weapons of war, and she used them to drive a wedge between Mithrax and his daughter. She revealed the truth of Mithrax’s past—and why he held the relics in such fearful regard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As it turned out, long ago, Mithrax’s mother had done the unthinkable. She and her crews had been on the Moon and had narrowly escaped death by the Hive as she entered the Pyramid of Luna—Nezarec’s Pyramid. Within the vessel that had invited them in, she found Nezarec’s body. Sensing the power within it, she and her other crew members dissected the body of the dead Disciple. These pieces were distributed among the pirate crews, and from them they drew dark and terrible power. Mithrax inherited one such relic—one of Nezarec’s talents, perhaps—a gift from his mother. With its power, he became a powerful pirate lord and terrorized the system in his early days. Eliksni, Human, Awoken—it didn’t matter. He would watch them all suffer so that he might get his way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Spider had long hinted at this darker version of Mithrax’s past, and as it turned out, the Spider and his now-deceased brother Siviks, the former leader of the Kell’s Scourge, had been members of Mithrax’s crew for a time—members who had later been exiled by Mithrax. With the truth now revealed, Eido was beyond infuriated with her father—not only for keeping the truth from her but also for the nature of his actions in the past. It would not be easy for her to forgive him. But much as Eido might have understood the knowledge of the past, the context of actually living it was another thing entirely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Drifter tried to speak to her. His time in the Dark Age had shown him the hostility and harshness that the world had unveiled, and he attempted to get her to empathize with her father’s position at the time. Unfortunately, Eido was not so easy to console, and the reckless streak born of her curiosity was only emboldened by the discoveries about her father. As we recovered more of the relics, trust might have slowly mended—but it would not fully heal in time for what happened next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Things came to a head in the battle for the final relic. Eido had gone ahead and claimed it personally, but Eramis was hot on her trail—and so were another force, the Lucent Hive. Their reason for desiring the remains of Nezarec was unknown, but in a somewhat unexpected turn, Eramis defended Eido from the Lucent Brood. Eido and Eramis were technically enemies of different houses, but in Eido, Eramis had seen hope—a new generation of Eliksni that might be free of the old rot that clung to herself and Mithrax. They were both relics themselves, relics of a generation that had known nothing but war and strife: the betrayal of the Great Machine, the darkness of the Whirlwind, the terror of the Long Drift. Eido had not been born into these times, and so she had a chance to live a life for herself—to live a life governing the new future of the Eliksni, a future that could be improved. And so, the Kell of Darkness defended the Scribe of Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, we arrived on the scene and saw Eramis with her blades drawn and Eido defenseless. With this, Mithrax immediately assumed the worst and engaged Eramis in a duel. With the aid of his splicer tricks, he came out on top easily. Only Eido’s words—explaining how Eramis had defended her—stayed Mithrax’s hand from delivering a killing blow. With a momentary break in combat, Eramis fled the battle and left the last of the relics in our possession. She retreated, knowing that while we would celebrate our victory, her house would bear the brunt of the failure she had just delivered to the Witness. It does not forgive, and it expects results from its supplicants. Its wrath would soon be felt across the entirety of the House of Salvation, and Xivu Arath would be the one to bring them their dark deliverance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With all the relics acquired, we had time to focus our resources on the matter of peace for a while. We helped rebuild the Eliksni Quarter in the former Botza district, and with his people safe, Mithrax had time to study the relics in safety. Though he used the darkness within them, he channeled it for a power of good—proving yet again that darkness is not evil, but instead a neutral force. The darkness is a power linked to the mind and to memory, and Mithrax’s hope was that he could distill that darkness into a purer form. With its ability to provoke memory and emotion, this pure essence was distilled into a medicinal solution—one that would finally give Saint-14 the means to rouse Osiris from his long slumber.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After a happy reunion, Osiris told us of the things he had gleaned while sleeping. During his abduction, he had seen into Savathûn’s mind, just as she had walked in his body, and from there, secrets had been taken. He had seen visions of a distant city on Neptune and of a secret that Savathûn had hidden away there long ago. Osiris would spend the next few months searching ravenously for answers. When he found them, it would be in the form of an old ally who had returned from the brink of death. It was time for Ana Bray’s work to pay off. It was time for the Warmind Rasputin to arise one last time in the defense of humanity.
