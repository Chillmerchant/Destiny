                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the wake of humanity’s Collapse, the Exodus Green is pulled into a singularity where its crew, including Alice Li, Mara Sov, and Uldren, are transformed by a fusion of Light and Dark into the immortal Awoken. Within a new world called the Distributary, their society splits between those wishing to return to Sol and those who wish to remain. Mara subtly maneuvers events, eventually revealing herself as the true architect of their transformation. After political upheaval, war, and a fateful duel, Mara leads a faction back to a devastated Sol system, founding the Reef and dividing the Awoken once more—between those who serve her and those who return to aid humanity.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> In the midst of the Collapse, an Exodus Program vessel—the Exodus Green—was partway through its journey into the stars. The passengers and crew were meant to form a new outpost of humanity somewhere out in the universe. Their plans were first interrupted by a silent shadow that was stalking their ship through the cold reaches of space. The ship’s captain, Alice Li, hailed the pursuing vessel multiple times to no avail.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The phantom pursuer alone would be troublesome enough, but this vessel was likely one of the Black Fleet’s pyramid ships—thus spelling an almost certain doom when it caught up with them. Their plans were further altered by the beginning of the Collapse. The Warmind Rasputin dispatched orders to the Exodus Green to begin using its defensive kinetic weapons as artillery and to return to the system to counter the arriving threat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alice Li, pursued by a mysterious assailant and being recalled to fight for a system she would soon not even call home, ignored the Warmind’s orders and sought to save her crew. Her defiance would not win her any mercy with her pursuers, which quickly entered weapons range and began to violently grip the vessel with gravity waves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alice Li and the rest of the crew were being stretched on a molecular level, torn asunder slowly as they tried to flee desperately. In this moment, Alice Li sent out every comm buoy and antenna that she could possibly extend. She sent out a request into the dark for anything to hear that might care. She declared her intention—that she and her crew were to be considered a separate entity from humanity and Sol, a neutral party with no allegiance to Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether or not this made any difference to their fates is unknown, but there was at least one crew member who was determined to take fate into her own hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her name was Mara, and she had seen that she was likely to die. She wished to go out on her own terms, so she donned a space suit and went out on a long tether from the main vessel. Her brother, Uldren—as was his nature—followed in her footsteps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Alice Li sent out her message, with the Exodus Green surrounded by darkness, a sudden light appeared. In that moment, a clash of primordial forces took place, and the very fabric of the universe buckled. A singularity formed within that clash of Light and Dark, and it began to drag the Exodus Green into its depths.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeing his sister in mortal peril, Uldren reached out and beckoned Mara to return to the Exodus Green, but Mara did not look back. And as the ship, and Uldren, and Mara were pulled toward the singularity, the young woman who would one day be one of Sol’s mightiest sovereigns cut the cord connecting her to the vessel and reached toward infinity. She would choose her own fate. She would be the first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within the singularity, everything would change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The people of the Exodus Green would awaken on the other side of the singularity, and they would be forever changed by the synthesis of Light and Dark that they had encountered. Alice Li was the first to wake, and she discovered Mara Sov next. And as the future queen arose from a cold dream, the two of them beheld what Alice Li believed to be a world of her own creation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Deep within the singularity, a world had been created. Its rivers flowed like silver, and its endless forests teemed with life uncounted. They called this world the Distributary, and as it was located on the other side of the black hole, it was separated from the ravages of Sol. Inside the singularity, time also passed far more rapidly than it did outside. And so, what might be but a second for us might have been a hundred years for those who lived in the Distributary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Slowly, Alice Li and Mara Sov began to wake up the others, until most of the forty thousand or so crew and passengers of the Exodus Green were also roused from their slumber. Their numbers were harshly imbalanced, with the majority of the crew being women. As a result, the society that developed within the Distributary was a matriarchal one, and the men of the new civilization were not often assigned to any positions within their hierarchy that might be considered hazardous in any manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With their lifespans being practically infinite within the depths of the singularity, these people were functionally immortal. Each of them would grow to become a fount of knowledge and experience, mastering their many crafts over the thousands of years. With their skin turned hues of blue, gray, and purple, these new people strode out across the Distributary and declared themselves to be children of a covenant between the Light and Dark.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They would call themselves the Awoken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Awoken were immediately split between those of the 891 originally remaining crew of the Exodus Green and the forty thousand or so passengers who had simply been colonists in stasis aboard. The 891 were considered to be leaders, and the 40,000 were in many ways subordinate. But regardless, there were questions that all the newly reborn Awoken would be asking about their foundational experience—the existence they now found themselves in.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Answering these questions could determine the balance of power amongst this new people for time immemorial, and so a council was convened to address all concerns. Chief amongst them was whether the Awoken should return to where they had come from and leave the Distributary, or remain within its bounds to prosper eternally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Those that wished to leave were known as the Eccaleists, who believed that the Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos that had saved them from destruction. Those that wished to stay were known as the Sanguine, who believed that the covenant of Light and Dark that had created the Awoken had been made with the understanding that they would forfeit all right to their history in exchange for a new start here within the Distributary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alice Li proudly proclaimed the Sanguine position and declared that the Awoken should go forth and explore the infinite cosmos of the Distributary. In secret, Mara Sov would counsel others gathered by her reborn brother Uldren and would state that, when the time was right, they would all return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alice Li would leave this first council in an ascendant position and proclaimed herself to be the first queen of the Awoken, as she believed herself to be the first of the Awoken to have ever existed. After the many decrees about the Awoken people that day were spoken aloud into covenant and law, Alice Li made her first command as the queen of this newly reborn people: there would be no lies amongst the Awoken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Little did she know that this well-intentioned first decree would be the source of so much pain—and would also bring about her downfall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the Awoken people expanded out across the Distributary, some would form tribal groups out by the forests and seas. Predominantly, these people were of the Eccaleist persuasion. Those who dwelled in the cities, on the other hand, tended to be of the Sanguine mindset. Unbeknownst to all but a few, the seeds for division were laid in this foundational difference.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, a woman from the original 891 crew of the Exodus Green came forward with words like fire. She was the Diasyrm, and she loudly proclaimed that Alice Li had committed deicide—the murder of a god.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It had long been accepted that Alice Li had been the creator of the Awoken people and the Distributary. The Diasyrm stated that Alice Li could have chosen for all the Awoken to have a divine form, but that she had instead chosen to grant them the same mortal form that they had maintained in their past lives. The Diasyrm claimed that, through this choice, Alice Li had effectively created all Awoken suffering in the universe. She had killed their potential divinity in its crib.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The real damage of the statement was not simply the notion that all Awoken had been denied an existence without suffering. It was also that Alice Li had potentially lied by omission. She was meant to be the queen without secrets, and yet she had kept the most terrible secret for herself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This moment—this accusation of the murder of unborn gods—would be the event that began the first war of the Awoken: the Theodicy War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to this moment, there had been no need for paladins or protectors. But with the Theodicy War, a Rubicon of conflict was crossed, and the Awoken were changed forever. The war would erode the authority of the queen, and she would eventually send Osana Sov, Mara Sov’s mother, to negotiate with the Diasyrm and sue for peace.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When Osana met with the Diasyrm, she promised her that her daughter, Mara Sov, would tell her any secret she desired to know in exchange for peace. And so it was that the Diasyrm traveled to meet Mara Sov atop the mountain where she resided—and was never seen again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The questions of what happened and how the Diasyrm disappeared persist in the legends to this day. Did Mara kill her? Did she cease to be upon hearing an unimaginable secret? Did she change her ways and choose a new life after having caused the first war? Was it always Mara all along?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    None can be sure. But what we do know is that the Diasyrm was most certainly Mara’s puppet in this regard. She would allow the Eccaleists’ cause to wither for a time. She did not believe it was the right moment to return—but one day, return they would.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before that time arrived, Mara would have a chance encounter that would change her life forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the Sanguine’s factional truth flourished, their scribes gathered all knowledge, including portents and prophecy, to their side. In this way, they heard the discontent of Mara and Uldren, who still quietly supported the Eccaleists’ position. To these scholars, they represented something of an existential threat. If Mara were to ever gain power in the future, she could be the spark that started a second Theodicy War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, a colossal Awoken warrior entered the court of some of these scribes, armed with a longbow so massive that only a woman of her unchallenged strength could even string it, let alone draw it to its fullest length. She declared that her name was Sjur Eido, and that she was hunting Mara Sov for the murder of her lady, the Diasyrm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The scholars of the Sanguine saw this as a chance to potentially save thousands of lives by taking just one. So they did what they could to direct Sjur, though she would still not find her quarry for a long time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Under the Awoken’s second queen, Nguya Pin, a masked figure entered the royal court. This was Mara in disguise, and she would counsel the queen for a long time—swaying her to become an Eccaleist and encouraging her to open her court to all the knowledge of the world. The many scholars gathered there would be set to work in a way that suited Mara’s cause.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But one day, many years later, Sjur Eido would walk into this court—still furious over the death of the Diasyrm, still hunting Mara.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When she found Mara in her laboratory, she was stopped in her tracks. Her fury was suddenly tempered by Mara’s grace and beauty. Her hatred wilted, and something else blossomed in its stead. Sjur Eido could not bear to kill Mara, and so she threw down her weapon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She declared that she would instead wound someone beloved to Mara, thus leaving her forever maimed in spirit—because she could not bear to kill Mara in all her beauty.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara could not refuse this challenge, and so her brother Uldren became her chosen champion. The two warriors would battle each other with blade, with rifle, and with fifth-generation superiority fighters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The news of this duel sent the scribes who had sicced Sjur on Mara into a wild panic. Over the centuries since, they had found a place in the new queen’s court, and realized that if they were found to have sanctioned this murder, they would be banished.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Luckily for these idle scholars, the duel between Uldren and Sjur would have a most unexpected outcome.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When fighting with blades, the brute strength of Sjur was equal to the finesse and footwork of Uldren. They both fell together—and thus it was a tie.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When fighting with rifles, the two warriors fought in the Distributary’s great jungles. While Uldren was the greater hunter, Sjur used her disruptive power to brute-force a victory, swaying nature’s balance against Uldren and forcing the fauna to expose him. In this way, she secured victory and severely wounded Uldren in the process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For their final battle, both of them were supplied with any choice ship they desired. Sjur chose a powerful Ermine-Tac Interceptor. Uldren chose an outdated ship called a Dart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What Sjur failed to realize was that, per the terms of the duel, any weapons that could not be supplied would be simulated instead. The Dart's standard weapon loadout was capable of being switched with an air-to-air nuclear munition. Using this simulated munition, Uldren scored a kill from over 80 kilometers away—and Sjur Eido lost before she could even see him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The score was all tied up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Realizing the stalemate, Sjur threw herself before Mara and said that with the tie, her fate was in Mara’s hands. She pleaded for a kinder fate than that of the Diasyrm, whom she had sworn to avenge. Mara approached the humbled warrior and said, “Rise, Sjur Eido. Let us take the stars together.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The exact story of the blossoming love between Mara and Sjur is not recorded in complete detail, but given the lifespans of the Awoken were near infinite, it may have been a love that endured as unassailably as the moon and the tides it brings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara would have need of strong confidence, especially for what came next—and few among the Awoken were as strong as Sjur Eido.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara scoured the great archives of the Awoken, looking for knowledge. She had to prove what she already knew: the Awoken had to return to the greater universe. To do this, she launched countless satellites and instruments of observation into orbit around the Distributary. When she had sufficient proof, she would address the Awoken people and tell them a fundamental truth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara, at this point, was the face of the Eccaleist belief. With data to back up her assertions, she informed the Awoken of the reality they had to face. Returning to the universe at large would be perilous, and it would pull the Awoken from the Distributary—thus robbing them of their immortality. But Mara's sway over the people was immense.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What’s more, Mara told them of the fragments retrieved by the observation instruments. Though little had been heard, it was clear their kin on the other side were in terrible danger. The Awoken had escaped the same fate. The Distributary was a refuge, but they had arrived there by fleeing a madness more ancient than one might fathom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite the danger—and the guarantee of embracing mortality—Mara gained the support of tens of thousands of Awoken, thus granting her the people she would need for an exploratory expedition back into Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before she left, she knew there was one thing she had to do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara went to Alice Li—the first queen of the Awoken. She who had believed the Distributary to be of her own design. She who had been accused by the Diasyrm of robbing the Awoken of divinity. She to whom Mara had told the first lie.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sitting with her, Mara told her the truth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was not Alice Li who had created the Distributary. It was not Alice Li who had been the first among their people. It was not Alice Li who had denied the Awoken their divinity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was Mara.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She was the first.

                    <br>
                    Alice Li was enraged at the truth—knowing now that Mara had engineered all that had happened across the history of the Awoken. Knowing that Mara was guilty of the very thing she herself had been accused of—an accusation so strong that it had sparked the very concept of war in a universe unblemished by it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From that moment on, Alice Li threw her support behind Mara’s expedition—not out of agreement, but so that she could rid the Distributary of Mara forever. The last thing she ever called Mara was “the Devil.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After some preparation, the expedition was successful, and Mara returned to Sol.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was then that she discovered the system in utter chaos. She quickly established habitats and outposts within the reaches of what had once been known as the Asteroid Belt. It was now strewn with the abandoned, derelict vessels that had fled during the Collapse—only to be destroyed by the Black Fleet. A foul reef of dead ships.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mara’s Eutechs—the same group that would one day become the Techeuns—also discovered that various members of the Awoken expedition had developed new powers upon leaving the Distributary. These powers manifested most strongly in Mara herself, and she became like an amplifier to those around her.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It did not take long for Mara to proclaim herself the new Sovereign of this people, of the Awoken, of the Reef.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were, however, many who wished to immediately depart for Earth and assist their long-lost brethren. Mara urged caution and believed they needed to build up a stable base of power first. Many vehemently disagreed with her. There were even riots on the matter, which momentarily plunged the Reef into chaos.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Exploiting this opportunity, a new set of interlopers descended upon the Awoken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through the many painful years of the Long Drift, the Eliksni had arrived in Sol—more vicious and tenacious than they had ever been before. These Fallen momentarily clashed with the Awoken, and Mara, Sjur, and Uldren had to rally their people to fight off the invaders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the raiders were fought back, some of the Awoken took the opportunity to act on their desires. A vessel was quickly launched away from the Reef before anyone could stop it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeing her control begin to wither, Mara relented.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Awoken would be given one choice each: they could remain in the Reef under her rule and build toward a future for the system on their own terms, or they could leave now and assist humanity—at the cost of never returning again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, the Awoken—who had already been torn apart by those who left the Distributary and those who stayed—were riven once again into the Reefborn and Earthborn Awoken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Those who left Mara’s control would go on to do an immeasurable amount of good for the people of Earth. Many would even be judged as worthy of becoming Guardians upon their death.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The world they emerged into was a terrifying one. Where once humanity’s Golden Age had stood, now there was only ruin, rust, and the remains of those who had died in the Collapse.
