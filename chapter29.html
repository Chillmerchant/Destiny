                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the armistice with Caiatl, the Last City was plunged into an unnatural darkness—the Endless Night—born of a Vex simulation that threatened humanity’s survival. To combat it, Ikora enlisted Mithrax and his House of Light, forging an unlikely alliance between humanity and the Eliksni. As the City descended into fear and division, Saint-14 confronted his own past as the Eliksni’s monster and emerged as their greatest defender. Together, Saint, Mithrax, and the Guardians delved into the Vex network to uncover the source of the darkness: Quria, the Blade Transform, servant of Savathûn. When Quria fell and the night lifted, peace remained fragile. Lakshmi-2’s hatred ignited a failed coup that unleashed the Vex upon the City, leading to her death, the dissolution of the factions, and Osiris’s mysterious departure to the Reef—setting in motion a greater plan yet to be revealed.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Not long after we signed the armistice with Caiatl’s forces, tragedy befell the City once again. Seemingly out of nowhere, one night the sun set over the Last City—and the next morning, it did not rise. It was quickly discerned that the City had been cast into an endless night by a Vex simulation that prevented the sun from casting its luminance on the City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This endless night was, in itself, a terrible threat. It could mean an increase in lawlessness in the short term, but it would also bring long-term problems: dwindling crops and food production, a lack of solar power generation, and a general rise in unrest. All the while, there was a growing fear that things could get even worse. Nobody understood the true extent of the Vex’s power or whether this was the precursor to an invasion they might soon launch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Ikora Rey had a plan. While there were experts on the Vex within our own ranks, this particular issue required an altogether different touch. We had previously interacted with the Eliksni’s bioengineers, bodyhackers, and masters of machines—the Splicers. As it turned out, we had also met an Eliksni inclined to help us, one well-versed in these very skills. Mithrax, the formerly Forsaken, had been working in the background to grow his Eliksni House of Light and had made great strides toward his goal of creating allies of the Great Machine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We picked up his signal on Europa and helped defend him and his people against a group of Vex that had shot down his fleeing skiff. To stave off the Vex, Mithrax used his skill as a Splicer to open a portal for us into the Vex network itself. We did not enter some simulation that day—this was the first of many strides into the true network of the Vex. Our Light allowed us to traverse it in a manner only the most skilled of Eliksni Splicers could hope to achieve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After we destroyed the mind commanding the local Vex, a great hostile presence began to loom over us within the network, overriding Mithrax’s control and attempting to destroy us before we could escape. Mithrax ported us to safety, but we caught a momentary glimpse of the enormous Vex construct responsible before we were pulled back to Europa’s surface.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ikora knew that Mithrax’s people would continue to be hunted and harried if left out in the snow, so she offered them what might be the most extraordinary olive branch in the history of Sol. She invited them to live within the walls of the Last City itself. Mithrax graciously accepted, understanding that both the people of the City and his own would experience great turbulence before true peace could be achieved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To say that the Vanguard inviting the Eliksni into the City’s walls would be seen by many as a betrayal would be an understatement. The Golden Age had seen utopian ethics among most of humanity, but ever since the Collapse, those times were long gone. Ages of progress were overturned, and people knew fear and hatred again. In particular, the ugly rise of xenophobia within the City’s population saw a notable uptick with the House of Light’s arrival.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now there were targets—easy targets at that. Some particularly shrewd political figures sought to exploit this fact. Chief among them was Lakshmi-2 of the Future War Cult. She was a primary disruptor during this period and regularly stoked the fires of such hate. There were convenient—and often, in some cases, legitimate—concerns she could raise as shields or cloaks to hide or defend more egregious positions her followers might take. After all, someone being your enemy for a hundred years provides a convenient pretext to make whatever rules for them you desire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But such issues were complicated, and to say that the whole of the City was united against the House of Light would be incorrect. The Eliksni were refugees—just like every person who had come to call the City home. Either they were asylum seekers in their own age or descended from someone who had been one, and all had come to shelter beneath the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In previous generations, no matter who it had been, the citizens of the Last City had not pulled up the ladder behind them. They had welcomed all beneath the Traveler’s safety. When Lakshmi-2 stoked the worst instances of hate, some pushed back—even from within the ranks of the Future War Cult. Some left, realizing the direction she was going was one they could not abide.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet even as the populace of the Last City was split, other, more important figures needed convincing. Of all the great heroes of the Tower, Saint-14 would be the most influential voice in this matter. Mithrax approached him in the spirit of fairness each time they spoke, but Saint was naturally somewhat combative. Having seen the devastation of the Battle of the Six Fronts and the Battle of the Twilight Gap firsthand, he had crusaded against the Fallen Houses and witnessed them butcher his people in the distant past on Mercury. Winning his trust would be a mountain to climb.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, the Eliksni Quarter was vandalized by one of Lakshmi’s xenophobic mobs, and their Aether stores were destroyed. The House of Light truly had nothing. After Saint investigated the scene, he flippantly remarked that there were no witnesses and that people could not be expected to live alongside those they had always considered monsters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To this, Mithrax took a moment and, with a stern tone, enlightened Saint with his own perspective—revealing a story that would change him forever. He told Saint that there had always been a monster to the Eliksni, a monster they told their children about. Saint heard his own story that day, retold from the Eliksni perspective.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this retelling, his crusades were not great journeys into the wild to deliver justice unto the Fallen Houses. They were brutal, merciless campaigns of slaughter in which he had killed thousands of innocent Eliksni. This moment opened his eyes, particularly with one simple truth: he was the monster Eliksni parents warned their children of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They spoke of his insatiable rage—of how no Eliksni were innocent in his eyes, that they were all Fallen. Saint saw this reality when he looked into the eyes of Eliksni children. One day, one fell in his path, and as he offered a hand to help them up, they recoiled in fear. Saint had always defended the innocent, and a moment like this broke something within him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He had always believed himself to be the great protector of the City’s people. But knowing that children trembled at his passing, at even the shadow he cast on a wall, or the mere mention of his name—this challenged Saint to change. It forced him to realize that the world he had seen as black and white was far more complicated than he had ever given it credit for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From then onward, much to his credit, he changed his stance and became one of the staunchest advocates for the Eliksni. Together, Saint and Mithrax worked as one to counter challenges both within the City and beyond.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After all, Saint may have been enlightened, but that did nothing to stop the Endless Night. Together, we worked within the Vex network to understand how the Endless Night was being formed, why it was being formed, and what could be done to stop it. Delving deeper into their network, we learned to better use our Splicer abilities. After many incursions into different nodes of their system, we discovered that the Vex were being controlled by a single mind responsible for the Endless Night.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pursuing an understanding of which mind this was led us deeper into their network, where we began to see the telltale signs of the true threat behind the Endless Night. Deep within the Vex network, Taken infestation surrounded the nodes containing the information we needed. As we uncovered more, it became clear that the Vex mind controlling the Endless Night was none other than Quria, the Blade Transform.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This ancient Vex mind was the same that had invaded the court of Oryx long ago and had been taken by him before being gifted to the Witch Queen, Savathûn. She was the reason for the Endless Night. This was all part of her plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Descending upon Quria’s location, we confronted this powerful Vex mind and purged it from the network, bringing the Endless Night to a close at last. But even as Quria was destroyed, and we stopped to remember those we had lost, the politics surrounding the Eliksni’s arrival still caused uproar in the City—and Lakshmi was eager to exploit that moment for political gain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lakshmi had other influences steering her path. The Future War Cult had long possessed a device that allowed glimpses of potential futures. They had used it prior to the Red War to preemptively evacuate and arm as many civilians as possible. Now, Lakshmi looked into the device and saw a future where she ruled the City as a single, dominant dictator—a future in which the Eliksni were cast out and Mithrax was put on trial.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This, along with a few choice words from the Warlock Osiris, became the catalyst for her next action. Lakshmi gathered supporters from the FWC and New Monarchy, rounding up every Eliksni in the City before the Vanguard could respond. Following Osiris’s directions, she opened a portal in the Botza District, intending to banish the House of Light into the void of space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But unwittingly, she had been deceived. For some time, it seemed as though Osiris wasn’t truly himself, and this was confirmed when the portal Lakshmi opened at his direction did not lead to the vacuum of space—but instead to the Vex network. From there, the Botza District began to be overrun as Vex poured forth directly into the Last City. Lakshmi was killed in the opening engagement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Immediately, Guardians mobilized in force to enter the network once more and cut off the Vex incursion. Meanwhile, Vex had already escaped and were running rampant in the Eliksni Quarter. Saint-14 rushed to the scene, and when Mithrax stated that he should be elsewhere to defend his people, Saint retorted instinctively, “You are my people.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we shut down the gateway, Saint-14, Mithrax, Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Amanda Holliday converged on the Botza District, destroying what remained of the Vex. The Eliksni House of Light had been saved—more accurately, the people of the Last City had been saved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The remaining elements of the factions saw this as their chance to leave the City. In the aftermath, the factions effectively ceased to exist. There would be no more factions on the Consensus. There would be no more factions at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The City was left in a state of political limbo, meaning the only true commanding force within its walls would be the Vanguard—Ikora Rey and Commander Zavala. But the political turmoil and ramifications of this moment would have to wait for a day in the far-flung future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was another who quietly slipped away from the City in this moment, just as the factions made their break for it. Osiris made his way to the Reef. The final part of a plan put in motion long ago was coming into focus. Soon all would be revealed, and soon all would be clear. It would begin with the meeting of two monarchs—and a bargain that would change their fate.
