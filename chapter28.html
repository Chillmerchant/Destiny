                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the defeat of Xivu Arath’s forces, Empress Caiatl emerged from the ruins of Torobatl seeking an alliance with the Vanguard, offering unity against the Darkness—but only if humanity swore fealty to her. Zavala refused, sparking a tense cold war that unfolded through duels of honor and shadowed assassinations. Amid these trials, Crow’s secret identity as Uldren Sov was revealed when he saved Zavala’s life, earning unexpected forgiveness. Yet as peace was brokered, darker discoveries awaited—the derelict Cabal ship Glykon Volatus, where Calus had communed with the Witness through horrors born of Darkness. From its corrupted halls to the return of the Crown of Sorrow, the signs were clear: Savathûn’s next move was already in motion.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> The defeat of Xivu's forces was impressive not only to Spider but also to a watching pair of eyes from far beyond Sol's borders. Empress Caiatl, daughter of Calus and Ghaul's co-conspirator in the Midnight Coup, reached out to the Vanguard with an offer. She would join her forces with ours and fight by our side against the Darkness and the Hive. In return, all we had to do was swear allegiance to her and submit one from amongst our own ranks to sit on her war council as a Bracus. Subservience and safety at the price of freedom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was not a choice that Zavala was willing to make. He rejected the Empress’s offer. But true to her word and to her honor, she would not make war on us for a simple refusal of an alliance on her own terms. Zavala and Osiris were permitted time to leave unharmed. Yet from this first meeting, we risked a cold war with what remained of the Cabal Empire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Caiatl had arrived in whirlwind fashion from Torobatl and was calling for all the legions in Sol to join her cause with great haste. She offered them glory in the old ways of the Cabal and a place of honor if they could rise to become one of her chosen warriors. Behind this urgent marshalling of forces, there was a bitter tragedy at play. Caiatl had seen the Cabal homeworld of Torobatl fall to Xivu Arath’s forces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She didn’t just want supremacy in Sol like Ghaul did—she needed an alliance with Xivu Arath’s enemies. She needed the remaining forces of the Scout Legions and Red Legions. She didn’t want the Light itself; she wanted the aid of the Light to save her people. But she had just asked us to bow to her when our home had been invaded by her very own soldiers. They had brought humanity low and had nearly destroyed us. We could not simply oblige her and could not provide her with the alliance she sought on her own terms.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The war that brewed between the Vanguard and the forces of Caiatl’s ascendancy never boiled over into proper conflict. Instead, we would play a delicate diplomatic and pseudo-military game of sorts. Caiatl was inviting great champions from across the system, and with enough support, she would easily rally all of the Cabal forces. They would then be able to force the Vanguard into submission through a more deadly proposition than the original alliance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And thus, Osiris opted for a different strategy. We would personally enter into the trials that Caiatl was putting forward for her forces. As we entered, we would destroy the competition, preventing any successful champions from emerging amongst the remnants. This would keep Caiatl’s forces weak and, if nothing else, would mean that the Empress would need more time to rally her strength.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris would also adopt another change. Crow had been brought into the City and would be alongside him, acting as security for both himself and Commander Zavala. Crow would always wear his mask to keep his identity secret, removing it only in moments of silence and solitude.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One night, within the City gardens, Zavala also sought solitude. But neither he nor Crow was alone. A Psion assassin had been placed within the City walls, and their goal was to take the life of the Commander. Before they could carry out their mission, Zavala spotted them and quickly dispatched them—but not before Commander Zavala saw his face and, for but a moment, beheld the man who had killed his best friend. Crow wasn’t discovered properly that night, but the mystery of the situation didn’t end there.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through various communications, Caiatl insisted that she would not send forces to assassinate her rivals, and at this point in time, that notion made sense. Caiatl had acted with honor, and if she wished to employ underhanded tactics in her battle against us, we likely would have seen it earlier. There had even been a point at which Psion snipers directly aimed their scopes at Zavala and Osiris during their first meeting—but Caiatl had let them leave. She had not ordered them to be killed there, even though she could have. Using an assassin did not seem to be her style. Something else was at play.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless, this turn of events accelerated tensions within the Vanguard. Zavala, Saladin, and Osiris agreed on a risky gambit: Zavala would invoke the Rite of Proving. Two Cabal champions would traditionally face off against each other in this ancient practice, but instead, we Guardians would face Caiatl’s chosen champion, Ignovan, aboard one of her Imperial land tanks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we won, an armistice would be agreed to on our terms, and the Cabal and humanity would at the very least be at peace for now. But if Caiatl won, her original terms would be satisfied, and Zavala would join as a Bracus. Humanity and the Guardians would become a client species of the Cabal Empire, and the Vanguard would effectively be dissolved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ignovan, though a powerful Cabal, was no match for a paracausal force that had slain gods. With new powers of Darkness at our side, they were simply not ready for us. With our victory in hand, Caiatl was forced to honor the agreement. The armistice was ready to be signed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Caiatl and Zavala met on Nessus, accompanied by various dignitaries and Crow on our side. They were ready to proclaim their agreement in blood. But in the background, more Psion assassins were at work—and this time, they had a new tool up their sleeve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They had secretly stolen remnants of the technology once used to create the cage around the Traveler. While at the beginning of the Red War this had been a giant machine, the sect of assassins had secretly created a miniaturized version capable of draining the Light from a Guardian by caging their Ghost, thus rendering them mortal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala’s Ghost, Targe, was hit by one such round, and temporarily, Zavala became mortal. The sniper had made a perfect opening for a Psion close to Zavala to strike him down. Crow took the initial blow meant to end the Commander’s life, and his mask was shattered in the process. His cover was blown.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That sacrifice would have been for nothing if the next strike against Zavala had landed. But proving her honor—and knowing this would be the undoing of any possible peace between her and the Guardians—Caiatl grabbed the Psion, lifted it into the air, and slammed it to the ground, killing it before it could land the blow. Swiftly, she insisted that she had not ordered the attack, but that she would find the perpetrators. And so the armistice went forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Commander Zavala’s Ghost, Targe, was freed, and Zavala looked upon the man who had saved him. When he saw the face of Uldrin Sov, he realized what had happened. This was not the Prince of the Reef who had stolen away Cayde’s life, and so he did not strike him down—especially considering that Crow had just saved his life. Instead, he extended a hand of friendship and brought him to his feet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now that Zavala knew, he worked alongside us to keep Crow’s identity secret within the Vanguard until everyone was ready to accept him for who he was. Few others would be allowed to know of Crow’s true identity. This included Amanda Holliday, the Tower’s shipwright, one of Cayde’s closest and most trusted friends. Unwittingly, Amanda and Crow would become friends as well—both oblivious to the man Crow had once been and the sins of his past life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the time being, there were other occurrences throughout the system that needed our attention—none more troubling than the story of the Glykon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Cabal forces had picked up a deep-space anomaly near Mars. It was a pocket of Darkness unlike anything we’d ever seen, and yet it seemed to give us a hint as to what had happened to our stolen planets. A lost Cabal vessel had been sending out a distress call, and we stole the coordinates to this vessel from Cabal forces. Though Caiatl certainly wouldn’t approve, this theft led us to one of the darkest discoveries we had ever known: the discovery of Calus’s secret research vessel, the Glykon Volatus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For months, it had loitered near the Reef, abducting Scorn for experimentation. Calus was attempting to use these dead things as a method of communing with the Witness. It had reached out to Calus long ago and told him of the encroaching end, and Calus was determined to be its herald. But for so long, it had not responded to his calls.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It took a strange combination of Scorn experiments—reanimated again and again and placed within the Crown of Sorrow—to actually commune with the Witness. But when he did successfully commune, Calus suddenly vanished from the vessel. The records of a Guardian aboard, who briefly survived the encounter only to die later, told us what had happened next. His records described the Glykon like a scene from hell.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He stated that the ship had been dragged beyond Acheron’s Wall, pulled down into an underworld. When we boarded the ship, it was infested with Scorn, and all the Cabal crew were dead. But we also found a different kind of infestation—strange spores of Darkness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be our first encounter with the strange fungal lifeform known as Egregore, a vast web of fungal spores built upon the fabric of death itself. As we delved deeper into the vessel, we realized that we needed to use these spores to access deeper parts of it. Connecting to that network opened our minds, allowing us to see things from a deeper perspective—one that left us vulnerable as well, for it opened our minds to other influences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whenever we ran these missions, Osiris and Caiatl coordinated tactics with us. Osiris was able to find and decrypt various logs from the Glykon. He found Katabasis’s story, and we found what remained of him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, he was strung up in Egregore, consumed. His Ghost had brought him back so many times that it refused to resurrect him again, and Katabasis had been forced to put it down. The only thing left to remember the dead man’s tale was his weapon—a beautiful piece of Tex Mechanica engineering—also strung up in Egregore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But there was something else. Near the remains of Katabasis, we found the remnants of the dark artifact that had caused so much strife: what was left of the Crown of Sorrow. It was given to Osiris so that he might investigate it further and contain it safely should the need arise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though the darkness of the Crown was what Calus had used to link to the Witness, it’s worth remembering that before that, it had been placed on the head of Gahlran and had served another Dark Master. And soon, she would make her next move.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nightfall was coming—delivered unto us by the machinations of Savathûn.
