                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In a desperate bid to defeat Xivu Arath, the Hive God of War, Eris Morn performs a forbidden ritual within Savathûn’s throne world, ascending into the terrifying Hive God of Vengeance. Empowered by the Guardians’ tithes and her unbreakable resolve, she slays the resurrected Witch Queen and rises above all Hive deities in power—only to reject the corruptive lure of godhood. Instead of killing Xivu, Eris sacrifices her divinity to banish her, shattering the War God’s strength and restoring balance. From the ashes of these divine confrontations, Savathûn’s secret 15th wish is uncovered—revealing the path to follow the Witness through Ahamkara wish-magic, and setting the stage for one final reckoning within the Dreaming City.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Savathûn has always been cunning, and she knew that she might die at our hands one day. She had prepared contingencies just in case such an event might happen and had left those contingencies in the capable hands of her ghost, Immaru.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After we discovered his important role in all this, he reached out to us voluntarily, as his instructions from his master dictated. He would resurrect the Witch Queen, but on one condition — we had to deal with Xivu Arath, the Hive God of War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Destroying a Hive God is no small feat, and we had barely any time in which to do it. We could not easily locate Xivu's throne world, the Black Terrace, and so dealing a final death to Xivu would be next to impossible. We would need to fight the power of one Hive God with a Hive God of our own.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were perhaps only two people who knew the rituals of the Hive with intimacy enough to conduct such an affair: the uncooperative and partly deceased warlock Toland the Shattered, and the newly rising witch, Eris Morn — the last Bane of the Osmium Dynasty.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using Hive rituals and dark magics, Eris enacted the most terrifying ritual imaginable. Within a revealed secret spire in Savathûn's throne world, and with green soulfire in her heart and Hive scripture in her throat, Eris began to ascend. With ourselves, Immaru, and Ikora standing as witnesses to the event, we saw as she invoked the names of those who desired vengeance against Xivu Arath and the Osmium Dynasty.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She mantled vengeance, and vengeance became her blade. She was lifted into the air before us and began to change — her form twisting, spines growing from her back, claws elongating from her fingers. The ritual grew in intensity until it was a raging firestorm of green flame, and then it was over.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now Eris Morn stood before us, ascended into the Hive God of Vengeance. She was transformed, and she was now our only hope of defeating Xivu Arath. Her first words after this apotheosis would define our mission: “Bring me your tithes.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we did.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris Morn had created an Acolyte's Staff for us to use. It allowed us to take the destruction we had become so adept at creating and tithe that power to Eris Morn, just like any other Hive would to one of their own gods. The Staff, however, was designed to prevent us from having to partake in the Hive's own blood tithe, which eternally bound them to the path of violence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Using our own powers and offering them up as tithes, we would be able to empower Eris — and if she grew powerful enough, she would be able to take on the Hive God of War. But the task ahead of us was utterly monumental and fraught with danger. Xivu was the conqueror of a thousand worlds, and her might was near insurmountable already.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would need to collect as many countless tributes of violence for Eris as we could muster. All the while, she would be subject to an unending barrage of scrutiny. The Tower had been slowly pushed further and further with Eris' magic, and every time it had proved its usefulness. But every time, the boundaries were pushed further still.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be a step too far for many. Ikora would shield Eris from the scrutiny of the Tower where she could, even as she fostered some of her own doubts. But many others looked upon Eris' choices with fear and frustration in equal measure — none more so than Elsie Bray, the Exo-Stranger, who had experienced many dark futures where Eris Morn had ascended to rule the Hive, moments that had brought ruin and calamity to all of Sol and the Guardians of the Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we continued to explore Savathûn's spire at the heart of her throne world, Xivu's forces made a move of their own. Pushing in and invading Savathûn's throne world, Xivu delighted in Eris' transformation. She believed that Eris was now embodying the soul and spirit of Oryx, the Taken King — in being the one who wielded his slayers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She had embraced the mantle of a Hive God. She might easily take his place as first navigator in time. At the very bare minimum, she would stand alongside her as yet another sister — Oryx's purpose reincarnated. Xivu was hopeful that Eris Morn might simply embrace the power of the Hive, but Eris' resolve was greater than even Xivu had realized — a mistake that would be her downfall in the end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After many preparations had been made, we managed further explorations into Savathûn's throne world. We discovered that below the highest reaches of Savathûn's spire, but above the low oubliette in which the Altars of Summoning were located, there was a secret chamber within the spire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This hidden chamber was known as the Imbaru Engine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Imbaru is a dangerous and unique concept that was effectively created and weaponized by Savathûn. She is a Hive God of deception, and she gains power wherever lies and ignorance take root. Imbaru is essentially the empowering of Savathûn by one's own ignorance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An entire engine built around such a concept was designed as a puzzle — one meant to confound and confuse. It would slowly unlock over time, inviting us into its inner reaches to delve into deeper secrets still. But the mysteries of the Imbaru Engine would have to wait.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Xivu's forces were being massed, and it was clear that there would be a final confrontation with us soon. Immaru believed the situation had turned hopeless and was on the cusp of fleeing, but he was forced to remain even when he knew that Eris had not collected enough violent tithes to challenge Xivu Arath.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Ikora and Eris had a plan — a bold gambit. They would get only one chance, and if it failed, all of creation hung in the balance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After we defeated one of Xivu's great champions and conducted one last tithe to Eris, Ikora entered the ritual space in the Altars of Summoning and had Savathûn's body ported in. Immaru was instructed that, despite the terms of our agreement not having been completed, this was his last chance to resurrect his Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, begrudgingly, he did so. Life was breathed back into the Witch Queen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn returned to us from the dead and immediately made an about-turn to approach Eris Morn. Eris uttered only four words in response to the Witch Queen's musings on her new form: “I am your ruin.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With blinding speed, Eris took her blade in hand and cut the Witch Queen's throat. This was a true death — one of the Hive Gods slain in their own throne world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More importantly, unlike when we had slain Savathûn before, Eris was able to claim her power as a God of the Hive. The power that Eris claimed by killing Savathûn, in combination with the tithes of the Guardians, had momentarily left her as the most powerful Hive God in existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Taken King and First Navigator. The God of Lies and Deception. The God of War. All of them were nothing before Eris Morn — the Unbroken Blade, the God of Vengeance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And Eris turned her wrath on the God of War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She had all the might in the universe at her fingertips. Everything the Hive had ever done, everything they could ever be, was hers to command. If Eris had desired, she could have gone on from this moment to conquer all of the City, to rule the Hive, and to become their Dark Master.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But in their frail sword logic, she saw the weakness of the Hive. Tempting as the very nature of godhood itself might be, Eris's conviction was stronger. She did not succumb to corruption.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Instead, she made a choice that would define the nature of Xivu's existence forever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To kill Xivu would have been following the Hive's own way and would ensure that she stayed a god forever. The transformations had been momentary, brief as she absorbed the power within the oubliette every time the Guardians made a tithe. But if she killed Xivu, she would be transformed permanently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She had made a solemn vow to Ikora and to the Drifter that she planned to be with them — and even in the face of godhood, this vow stayed true.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So Eris summoned her power, and instead of using it as the sword logic might demand — to kill — she used it to banish Xivu Arath from her own throne world. This action took all her power, and she could not hold onto it because her actions were not in keeping with the sword logic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris was reverted to her mortal human form and fell to the ground. But in the moment that she collapsed, Xivu's wails of grief could be heard across the Ascendant Plane.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris had rejected the notion that she was Oryx, born again. She had shown the Hive God of War exactly why she was the Bane of the Osmium Dynasty. Xivu Arath's strength was shattered. She would never again be able to return to her throne world. She was banished from it. She was now mortal. Her next death would be her last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn was quickly raised once again by Immaru, and seeing us standing by Eris and Ikora, she quickly realized that there was a real chance she would be defeated again if fighting broke out between them. And so, she agreed to a temporary armistice of sorts. She left Immaru with us as collateral.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The entire reason for resurrecting the Witch Queen was so that she could tell us how to pursue the Witness, yet Savathûn had given us no clues about what this method was. When we inquired, she said that the way would reveal itself soon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so it did.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we delved deeper into the Imbaru Engine, we unlocked the deepest final chamber. Within it lay the greatest curiosity of all — the answer to our questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An egg. The egg of an Ahamkara — a wish dragon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was one of Riven's clutch. It was unlike the eggs ruined by Taken corruption in the Dreaming City. There was still life within this egg. It was the hint we needed to continue our investigation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We realized that we would need to use wish magic and an Ahamkara in order to pass through and follow the Witness. But what’s more, we remembered back to the moment of Savathûn's resurrection and deduced that there was a pattern in her wings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But this wasn’t just any pattern — it was a wish. Something meant to be put specifically to one dragon above all others: Riven of a Thousand Voices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was a unique code to be inputted on the device known as the Wishing Wall that Mara had constructed to more specifically bargain with Riven without adverse consequences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, it was revealed what this wish was — a wish to follow the Witness. The fabled and lost 15th wish. Savathûn had made it, and Savathûn had hidden it away all along.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This would be our deliverance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Suddenly our path was clear. The only way for us to follow the Witness into the Traveler's Pale Heart was using the wish magic of an Ahamkara. And there was perhaps only one of the dead dragons that still had the power to grant a wish of this magnitude — a dragon that had had dealings with Savathûn before.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Riven. Riven of a Thousand Voices. The last known Ahamkara. Ensnarer of the Forsaken Prince. Damning perpetrator of the curse on the Dreaming City. And Mara Sov's greatest secret.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to enter the heart of the Traveler, we would need to bargain with Riven — even though we had been her murderers. But we clearly had no choice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we returned once again to the Dreaming City to face the old monster that we had slain so long ago in the name of avenging our fallen friend, Cayde-6.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A final act of our story was about to unfold.
