                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Drawn to Europa by the call of the Black Fleet, the Guardians arrive to find Eris Morn, the Drifter, and the long-hidden Elsie Bray already mastering the dark power of Stasis. As Eramis, Kell of the House of Salvation, turns that same power toward vengeance and corruption, the Guardians confront her rising empire across the frozen wastes, learning to wield the Darkness without surrendering to it. Their pursuit leads them from the ruins of Riis-Reborn to the Deep Stone Crypt, where ancient Bray secrets and twisted Exo creations await. In the final clash, Eramis falls to her own frozen hubris, Taniks is destroyed, and the truth emerges—that Darkness and Light are not moral opposites, but forces to be understood, mastered, and balanced.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> We had heard the call of the Black Fleet. It beckoned us to the icy moon of Europa. It promised us salvation. It promised us power. As was our nature and our duty, we had to investigate what was going on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But we weren't the first to arrive on this icy moon. Prior to our touchdown, Eris Morn and the Drifter had both set foot on the moon's surface and met with a figure of infamy. At long last, it was time for the Exo-Stranger to step out of the shadows and introduce herself properly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we had learned some time ago, it was indeed Elsie Bray — the sister of Anna Bray and granddaughter of Clovis Bray I — who had been the Exo-Stranger. She had come, in this moment of great need, to instruct Eris and the Drifter on how to use the powers of Darkness. Both Eris and the Drifter had embraced a new power: Stasis — an element of control and will that manifested as cosmic ice, sapping the energy from things and forcing them into a state of submission.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Elsie also knew this power and would teach them both to use it without fear of falling to its corruption. This was a departure from Elsie’s previous actions in other timelines. In many of the timelines that had come before, she was a prisoner of sorts. She would always see repeated timelines of evolving fates. She would always be able to intervene, but in every timeline prior, she had lost. The forces of the Witness had been triumphant. The forces of good had failed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Commonly, this would occur when someone obtained Stasis and didn’t have a guiding hand to help them control the Darkness. And in this cycle, instead of trying to lock Stasis away — a plan that inevitably failed — she decided that she would teach us to use it. In those previous dark timelines, Eris Morn had betrayed the Tower and become a terrible dark god of the Hive, with little care for her human comrades. Now, with those powers under her control, we stood a fighting chance. Neither she nor the Drifter would fall to corruption. They would be staunch allies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But as the Nine predicted long ago, all fates were converging on us, and we would need to tread this same path without wavering if there was to be a chance for humanity — and all of existence — to survive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we arrived on Europa, we saw that the Pyramids were already there and quickly picked up a distress signal from Variks the Loyal. He had not been seen since he instigated the riot at the Prison of Elders, but now he offered help to us — and was asking for help in return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were not the first to reach the old scribe, though. His new taskmaster, whom he had once again chosen to betray, was hot on his trail. She found him quickly as he tried to send his pleas out to the rest of the system. His new leader was Eramis, the Kell of a newly rising Fallen house.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within herself, she had discovered a new resolve — born of hatred. This came after her failure to recover SIVA. Instead of looking to the old ways, she had discovered a means to use an entirely new power. She had ventured to Europa and immersed herself in the dark power of the Black Fleet. Now she too wielded Stasis — a power that was quickly corrupting her, as Variks could see.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With her reformed band of Fallen behind her, she created a new house known as the House of Salvation, and told them that with their new power, they would no longer be bound to the fate of the Great Machine. They would be freed in Darkness, and Stasis would be how they fought back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She commanded her forces to kill Variks, and we arrived just after she left. With just enough time to save the scribe, he told us to spare him despite his actions leading to the death of Cayde. Together, we had to focus on Eramis — to stop her before she could use her dark powers to create further evil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So we ventured straight to her stronghold, a new Eliksni city built atop humanity’s Golden Age ruins — Riis-Reborn. There we saw Eramis’s command of Stasis and realized that it was too strong to confront. We were forced into a hasty retreat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Returning to Variks, we began to hear the voice of the Witness through our Ghost once more. It attempted to draw us in again, beckoning us to a lonely ice shelf far off in the wastes of Europa. In those wastes, a ziggurat from the Pyramid ships had set down, awaiting our arrival.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before we could reach it, Elsie Bray, Eris Morn, and the Drifter intercepted us. And after seven long years of absence, at last Elsie had time to explain. She told us the terrible truth — that we would need to learn how to use Stasis in order to conquer our foes. And with her guidance, we took our first steps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At first, we had to use splinters from the Black Fleet’s vessels to control our Stasis powers. Eramis had hunted down Variks initially because he had stolen one of them. Acquiring more splinters over time gave us greater control and a deeper connection to Stasis. We obtained these splinters from some of Eramis’s greater commanders, such as Praksis the Technocrat and Phylaks the Warrior.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the process, we weakened Eramis’s Dark Council and removed powerful advisors from her side. She became more and more reckless, and thus her vulnerabilities could be exploited.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Commander Zavala eventually took note and arrived on Europa to provide us with necessary intelligence — and something of a dressing down. We would need to be controlled now that we wielded this strange dark power, and more importantly, a threat assessment had to be made.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zavala made it clear that he did not approve of our use of Stasis, but he still gave us the intelligence we needed to continue the fight. Namely, that Eramis had sent raiding parties to the Cosmodrome, including one of her sub-commanders known as Bakris.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We went to the Cosmodrome and prevented the House of Devils — Eramis’s old house — from reinforcing the House of Salvation with dozens of Spider Tanks. Eramis grew more desperate still, heading to the Vex portal on Europa to unleash the Vex there. These forces would slow us down, or perhaps kill us if Eramis was lucky.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Variks pleaded with her not to do this; it would harm her own people. But she would not be swayed. She claimed that all her actions were made in service to Riis and to her people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The portal that opened at the end of the Glassway led to a Vex forge star known as Volantis-2082, and soon the Vex began to pour forth from it. Radiolarian fluid flowed through the portal as well, returning to a place it had once been sent long ago — the Deep Stone Crypt, where the Exos were born, and where another of Eramis’s commanders, Atraks, awaited it with her own dark purpose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the Vex pouring forth, they began to swarm Riis-Reborn, providing us with an opportunity to strike at Eramis for good. We ascended to the summit of the Fallen city and faced the Kell of Darkness. Her power of Stasis was great, but we had learned to control our own rather than letting it control us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our power came not from the splinters, but from within — and Eramis could stand against us for only so long. She was frozen in place by the very power that she claimed would be her liberation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Witness does not abide failure. While it had failed to corrupt us, Eramis had failed to kill us — so she would bear the brunt. She was imprisoned for her failure until the Witness saw a use for her again. Her power was ended, momentarily, but a few of her commanders still remained.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The House of Salvation would not be so easily destroyed, even after the fall of its Kell. We had to hunt them down as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First was Kridis, the Dark Priestess, who made herself visible and easy to hunt. The remaining commanders under Eramis’s banner fled to an even deeper installation within Europa — the Deep Stone Crypt. Elsie made it clear that we needed to pursue them with all haste. Europa’s greatest secrets could not fall into the hands of the House of Salvation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Crypt was defended by an unconventional AI, as well as many of the House Salvation troops who had accompanied Eramis’s remaining commanders. The AI warned us against interfering with the Crypt and promised calamitous consequences if we ignored it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But we had to stop the House of Salvation. In the deepest parts of the Crypt, we saw the last two leaders — one of whom was very familiar. Atraks had used the power of the Deep Stone Crypt to become one of the first Exo-Eliksni. Dozens of copies of her spread throughout the facility, ready to do battle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then there was Taniks the Scarred — the legendary Fallen mercenary who had no house and would kneel before no banner, until Eramis gave him a cause worthy of his prowess.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we discovered Taniks, we also discovered the veiled statue that had been used by Clovis Bray to alter the collected Radiolarian fluid from the Glassway. It turned out that this altered fluid was a critical component in creating the Exos. The great secret of their creation was revealed: there was Darkness within all of them. Every single one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taniks fled into orbit to Clovis Bray’s space station, the Morning Star, which was locked geosynchronously to the Deep Stone Crypt below. We had to transit between the Crypt and the station to reach Taniks, but not before defeating nearly a dozen copies of Atraks-1. Whether we truly ended her life or not remains up for debate, but regardless, we all ended up at the top of the Morning Star Station, ready to pursue the last commander of the House of Salvation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we went deeper into the station, the AI contacted us once again, declaring that we were out of warnings — and that the Nuclear Descent Protocol would now be initiated. It praised the name and genius of Clovis Bray, claiming that what we had discovered was the font of eternal life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we discovered Taniks, the station’s orbit was destabilized, and its nuclear cores were activated. It began to plummet toward Europa. If it made contact, and the nukes weren’t disarmed, the entire moon would be destroyed — along with everyone on its surface.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taniks and the House of Salvation troops on board tried to stop us as we all plummeted from space, but despite their efforts, we managed to disarm the nuclear warheads aboard the Morning Star. Before we were destroyed by the impact, we found safety inside a sealed room.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taniks was not so lucky. He missed the door — but he was far more resilient than we realized. As we climbed from the wreckage, we found ourselves once again before the Crypt. The entirety of Europa’s surface was covered in the remains of the Morning Star.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole station had come crashing down, breaching the Crypt — and there, we discovered the true extent of Taniks’s resilience. He emerged as a terrifying construct of metal and malice. This was perhaps his final gambit, his last form. The remaining nuclear warheads from the Morning Star had been incorporated into his chassis, and we had to continually disarm them as we fought to destroy this monster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like Cayde did so long ago, we put an end to Taniks — but this time, he wouldn’t be coming back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Taniks fell and the Crypt was unlocked, the deepest secrets of Europa were revealed. The Crypt AI we had been interacting with was no AI at all — it was the reactivated remnants of Clovis Bray I.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His story on Europa was a strange one. As it turned out, two copies of his mind had been made. One had remained on Europa, preserved within a giant mechanical head — as close to the original Clovis as could be. The other copy had become an Exo — one whose first designation was Clovis I.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That version of Clovis Bray, long ago in the Golden Age, had been one of the leaders who helped rally the Exos to fight off the invading Vex. These Vex had originally come from the Forge Star Volantis-2082. The Exos shut down the Vex gate, and Clovis sacrificed himself through many Exo resets to accomplish this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With that in mind, he decided to change his name — going from Clovis-43 on his last reset to a new name upon his 44th iteration. He would be named after the wail of his sword, the nickname he had earned as he cut down countless Vex. He would become Banshee-44.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As it turned out, he had been alongside us in the Tower all this time — our faithful but forgetful Gunsmith. Exos are not meant to be reset that many times, and so it’s no surprise that Banshee didn’t remember.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Clovis AI begrudgingly helped us learn the last secrets of Stasis, and we ultimately gained mastery over the element — for ourselves, and without the risk of corruption.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With that, we learned a fundamental truth: Darkness was not evil, just as Light was not inherently good. Appearances were not what they seemed. Those with previously unscrupulous or evil intentions could turn from Darkness and find the side of good — a lesson we would learn many times, not least of which when we returned to the Tangled Shore.
