                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Ana Bray’s relentless work to rebuild Rasputin draws her into a web of deception, war, and sacrifice. With Clovis Bray’s manipulative genius enlisted to restore the Warmind, old allies and enemies collide as the Hive god Xivu Arath plots to turn their efforts into an act of worship through endless conflict. When Rasputin discovers that Clovis sought to control him and that Xivu’s trap threatens to doom humanity, he makes the ultimate sacrifice—destroying the Warsats and himself to prevent catastrophe. His final act reveals the existence of Neptune’s hidden colony and the mysterious artifact known as the Veil, even as the Traveler halts its retreat and the Witness begins its final assault.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Ana Bray had been working on Rasputin's systems for months now. Osiris's return had prompted her to redouble her efforts, given that only Rasputin could seemingly verify the existence of a hidden human colony on Neptune. Despite having a vast amount of Rasputin's data saved from the Martian pillory engram, the data was still incomplete. If we were going to successfully reconstruct a Warmind, we would need the assistance of its other creator. This was the assessment of Osiris. Clovis Bray I would need to be involved in order to salvage Rasputin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Descending upon his complex on Europa, we discovered quickly that his position was being overrun by the Hive and the Wrathborn of Xivu Arath. They were quickly pursuing Clovis, but they had clearly returned to the system in force to accomplish more goals than simply this. The House of Salvation troops that were fighting alongside Xivu's Hive were also different. They no longer had their free will. They were Xivu's latest Wrathborn—the dark soldiers that had been corrupted by her influence and the Cryptoliths, turned into mindless beasts of war. Eramis's house was being punished, and this was not the only way in which that punishment would manifest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The return of the War God had created another reason to resurrect Rasputin. It could be a powerful weapon, and if its Warsat network could be brought online again, it could be used in a decisive manner to defeat Xivu Arath's forces. After saving Clovis from the Witness's forces, he agreed to assist us in rebuilding the Warmind. He arrogantly stated that he would be required for the process, as only a mind of his singular genius could possibly be trusted to coordinate this Herculean task. And so Ana took a moment to transfer him from his facility on Europa into her prototype exoframe, where Rasputin was being rebuilt. This would allow Clovis to more closely monitor the Warmind's restoration.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to return Rasputin to life, we would need data—mountains of it. The data needed to construct Rasputin once more could be found in his old subminds, such as Charlemagne and Malahayati. Acquiring these old fragments of knowledge would be like finding pieces to a puzzle, and slowly, we would rebuild the Warmind. Some of the Warmind's own code would also be able to help us. The more of it there was, the more Rasputin would be able to reconstruct on his own. His heuristics would be able to fill in the gaps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But even as we embarked on this task, Elsie Bray would caution us against trusting Clovis too much. She had dealt with him plenty of times before, and she knew that he relied on his manipulative character to get his own way. She also knew that his agenda was often not to be trusted. He was self-serving to the maximum. If he was working to rebuild Rasputin, there was bound to be a reason for it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we worked to reconstruct the Warmind, we uncovered yet more of its secrets. Floating in orbit above the Last City, there was an orbital platform known as the Seraph Station. It contained yet more Warmind data and also held the possibility to be a command station for the Warsat network should the need arise. A powerful asset to secure for sure, but at the station's heart, we saw a terrible sign of what had happened to the House of Salvation. They had raided the facility for certain, but they were not led purely by Eliksni. They were led by Hive, they were led by Wrathborn, and then the sign of the Witness's cruelty could be seen firsthand. Praksis, the Technocrat—an Eliksni we had killed back on Europa—had been risen by the Witness as a Scorn. Infused with darkness, his ether had been corrupted, and he had become an undead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eramis reached out to us in this moment. She made it clear that this was the fate of her house and that it was a regret that would travel with her for the rest of her days. Upon securing the station, we would be able to transfer its control over to Rasputin's systems. With more of Rasputin's submind architecture restored, Ana Bray would begin searching further afield for new sources of Warmind data. She stumbled upon a novel, an ingenious source of it—a Ghost. Specifically, the one that had belonged to the Iron Lord Felwinter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After all, Felwinter was intimately connected to the Warmind. He had been one of Rasputin's Siddhartha Golems—the spies, the eyes, and ears that Rasputin had sent out into the population so he might know them. Rasputin's data was contained within Felwinter, and his Ghost contained some of that data as well. We found its remains at the Iron Temple and returned that data back to the Warmind. Then something remarkable happened. Felwinter's memories and personality were merged with the Warmind, giving it new perspectives and allowing it to emerge and speak for itself for the first time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It swiftly made contact with us and told us that Clovis Bray was not to be trusted—that he had deceived us all. Rasputin informed us of what Clovis's original goal for the Warmind was. He told us how he was meant to strike down the Traveler and replace it as humanity's war god. All this was meant to be accomplished with a protocol known as ABHORRENT IMPERATIVE, the same protocol that would allow Rasputin to strike the Traveler with its Warsat network. Rasputin also informed us that Clovis Bray planned to merge his systems with that of the newly reborn Warmind and to use it to gain control over all of Rasputin's Warsat network. With these weapons at his disposal, and being integrated into Rasputin's code, Clovis Bray planned to ascend and become a mechanical god for humanity—the great leader that would shepherd us into the future, the last universal common ancestor of all human progress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clovis Bray, as per usual, simply wanted to be the one in control. He had always been a madman, self-obsessed from the beginning, and this time, sadly, was no different. Ana and Elsie immediately confronted Clovis with this knowledge, and he was quickly removed from the exoframe and sent back to his original facility on Europa. In his place, the newly resurgent Warmind would emerge, and he would help to guide us to what we needed in order to complete the rebuild of his systems. Not only would this allow him to better unearth the truth of the colony that Osiris had glimpsed in Savathûn's mind, but it would bring us one step closer to reactivating the Warmind's defensive capabilities in full.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It looked as though we might succeed for a bit, but soon it became evident that even our best-laid plans were not going to survive contact with Xivu Arath. Thanks to some clever deductions by Eris Morn and Eido, it was discovered that Xivu Arath was setting a trap for us all. The Warmind's revival was something she had anticipated, and in a spectacular display of her own power, Xivu was pressing us to rebuild the Warmind. And this is why: Hive gods feed off their ability to create whatever honors them. In Xivu's case, she is honored by war—not simply the act of making war on your enemies or battling them, but also the rituals that take place before: the maintenance of machines, the construction of weapons, the building of defenses, the sharpening of swords.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By preparing Rasputin and rebuilding a giant machine of war, we were effectively engaging in worship of Xivu Arath. This would all come to a head if the Warsat network was used. They were Rasputin's greatest weapons, and so long as they were used in an act of war, Xivu would be honored. She would gain enough power to open her portals to her throne world above Earth and begin a full-scale invasion. And if it just so happened that Xivu claimed the Warsats for herself, then all the better. They would be turned on the Traveler, and it would possibly be destroyed. If we used our great weapons, we lost—and if we let them fall into the hands of the Hive and the Wrathborn, we would also lose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rasputin made the final, tragic calculation. In order for us to be victorious, we had to refuse to play Xivu Arath's game in the first place. But his final, damning conclusion on the course of action we needed to take would take a few weeks to properly calculate. In the meantime, there were other strange rumblings coming from around the system. In particular, Osiris detected an anomaly on Mars. We had learned that the scars and temporal anomalies on Mars were the result of the Witness looking into the past and trying to uncover something. Osiris believed that it too was searching for the hidden colony in Savathûn's mind—the secret that she had hidden away. And so he asked us to go and investigate the areas that had been unveiled.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In particular, there was one spire, an old facility of Clovis Bray design, one that we had to investigate on Osiris's behalf. When we arrived, we found that the facility was designed to cage an AI and that it had been activated in the latest stages of the Golden Age by Clovis Bray. Clearly, it had been created as part of a system meant to contain Rasputin. But whilst there was an AI contained there, it wasn't a remnant of the great Warmind. It was Soteria—the AI built by the Ishtar Collective and Clovis Bray during the Golden Age. The AI that had used Vex technology to incredibly accurately predict the future—a future in which it foresaw the arrival of the Black Fleet and had tried to save humanity in the process. It had been contained here for its disobedience and for seemingly going rogue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Soteria was the reason that Rasputin knew about the encroaching forces of Darkness. And if she had been left to her own devices, Soteria might have been able to save some of the lives of humanity. But now she was contained here, save for her detached submind that she had sent out into the reaches of space, which had been picked up by the people of Neomuna. Our discoveries on Mars were important. By digging deep into Soteria's prison—the so-called Spire of the Watcher—we were able to uncover yet more proof of the potential for a colony to exist out in the reaches of Neptune. But this knowledge alone would not be enough to stop what was coming next.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our discoveries were important, but Xivu Arath was on the move. And as the Coalition gathered to discuss what was to be done, Rasputin found the solution to Xivu Arath's trap. The only solution was for the Warsats to be destroyed—and for him to perish along with them. This way, nobody risked using the Warsats to inadvertently trigger Xivu Arath's trap. Everything was coming to a head now, and perhaps realizing that we weren't taking Xivu's bait—perhaps seeing an opportunity to finally achieve her revenge—Eramis forced our hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we prepared on our own terms to destroy the Warmind, the House of Salvation struck out in force and made their way to Seraph Station. Eramis would board the station and would move to activate the ABHORRENT IMPERATIVE protocol. Had we gained control of the Warsat network, we would have used them as tools against the Witness's forces. But under Eramis's commands, the Warsats began to turn and targeted the Traveler. In a moment that shocked all who looked on, as the ABHORRENT IMPERATIVE protocol was all but armed, something began to move within the Last City. Every Guardian could feel it—like a great cosmic wind rushing toward them from the center of the city.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And as they all turned to look, the Traveler moved. The Traveler was leaving, just like it had with every civilization before. It had chosen its moment. The Witness was nearly here. It had decided that now, it would abandon humanity and save itself, as it had done countless times before. It entered orbit and was quickly swarmed with Warsats, deploying their weapons in preparation to fire. Over the comms, Mithrax pleaded with Eramis not to fire the Warsats, trying to speak for the sake of all their people. But Eramis was unswayed, and she would be under the watchful eyes of a darker presence. She had made her choice. She would take her revenge. She activated the Warsats, which began to charge, ready to fire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this moment, when all for but a brief second felt like it would be lost, Rasputin and Ana Bray made the brave sacrifice. Rasputin told her that it was time. He had devoted himself to the defense of the people of Sol. He had bravely strode back into the world when it had destroyed him, and now, he would sacrifice himself for the good of us all. It was his choice. Devotion. Bravery. Sacrifice. He was deactivated. He died. And the Warsat network was purged—decimated before it could fire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And the Traveler, it seemed, was not blind to the Tyrant's sacrifice. It halted its retreat, hanging once again within Earth's orbit, standing defiantly against the forces of the Witness. It had seen the sacrifice of humanity's greatest protector. It would make its last stand above Earth once again. In death, Rasputin might not have destroyed the armies of the Witness, but he had undoubtedly saved humanity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He left us with a single message. By decoding his deepest and long-lost memory stores, he had discovered Osiris's lost colony on Neptune. He also discovered what the Witness was looking for on the colony. To us, it was simply an unknown artifact known as the Veil. We wouldn't understand its significance for quite some time, but it was the same artifact that Savathûn had hidden away—the same artifact that had been used to create the Witness by the precursor people. The artifact of Darkness that they had tried to link to the Traveler—one of the tools the Witness would use to enact the Final Shape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had to make our way to Neptune with all haste. But in the wake of the Warmind's death and the Traveler using this last moment to make a valiant stand, the great machine had been left exposed. The day we had all dreaded was here. The Black Fleet made its final move in earnest. The second Collapse was upon us, and the Witness would begin the final stages of the plan set in motion millennia ago. The Witness would rise. And the Light would fall.
