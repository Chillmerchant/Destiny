                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>As the Witness finally reached Earth, the Coalition’s defenses collapsed, and the Traveler struck back with a desperate surge of Light that failed to stop the oncoming end. Pursuing the Witness’s new disciple, Emperor Calus, to Neptune, we discovered the hidden city of Neomuna and its defenders, the Cloud Striders, and learned of a new Darkness power—Strand. Mastering it only through loss, we fought alongside our allies to stop Calus and the Witness’s attempts to unite the Veil and the Traveler, but despite our victory over Calus, the Witness used our own Ghost to open a gateway into the Traveler itself. Even as despair spread across the system, new fronts emerged—Nezarec’s resurrection, Mara Sov’s rising Queensguard, and the fall of Amanda Holliday—setting the stage for the next desperate phase of humanity’s war beneath the methane seas of Titan.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> The time of endings had arrived. As the Pyramid Fleet made its way to Earth’s atmosphere, it was supported by the various ships of Calus’s Loyalist Fleet — his newly titled Shadow Legion. Whilst their vessels fell easily enough, we had no defense against the Black Fleet itself. All the forces of the Coalition rallied to the side of humanity, but we were helpless against the Pyramids.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the mobile command vessel known as the Helm, all the Coalition’s leaders could do was stand back and watch. But in this moment of remarkable tragedy, something stirred within the Traveler — Light. It had detected the Witness’s darkness aboard the lead vessel of the Black Fleet, and it struck back with a chaotic beam of pure potential and life: the power of the Light made manifest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Pyramid vessel was sundered and overtaken with wild, luminous growths as a new seed of silver wings was planted in its hull. At the heart of the beam, the Witness had been caught within its full power. But as we would soon realize, it was utterly unaffected, and slowly began to approach the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We tried our best to intercept the Witness as it advanced, but it unleashed its terrible powers upon those Guardians who made their way to stop it. The ships, the Guardians, and their Ghosts were atomically sliced apart. They died instantly. Shipwright Amanda Holliday was among the attacking squadron, and while she wasn’t hit directly by the Witness’s powers, debris from the assault crashed into her vessel, forcing her to Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Humanity’s forces — and the Traveler itself — had proved ineffective against the Witness. The Black Fleet surrounded the Traveler and enclosed it in a containment field, shuttering its beam of Light. At long last, the Witness’s grand chase was at an end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It reached out, and upon nearing the Traveler, received a vision. It suddenly knew where the Veil was, perceiving it through its connection to the Traveler. With all haste, the Witness sent its newest Disciple — Emperor Calus and his Shadow Legion — to the location of the Veil: Neptune. Osiris quickly pursued them, along with us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now all the hopes of the universe rested on our shoulders. We didn’t understand what the Veil was or why it was important. All we knew was that the Witness was searching for it, and that its plans to end the universe relied upon it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We boarded a Cabal vessel just before it entered near-light-speed travel, and we found ourselves exiting NLS at the edges of the system, in the Outer Giants. We saw Calus’s forces beginning to touch down on Neptune’s surface and offered what help we could. Some of Calus’s vessels were vulnerable from within, and so we scuttled what we could before escaping to Neptune’s surface in Cabal drop pods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We followed the Cabal on a hope and a prayer. Diving deep into the clouds of a gas giant should have meant death — endless fall, crushing pressure — yet we emerged into a neon-soaked cityscape. We had discovered Osiris’s colony. We had rediscovered the secret human city of Neomuna.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our arrival was quickly noticed by the local protectors — the Cloud Striders, Nimbus and Rohan. Twelve-foot-tall, cybernetically enhanced warriors stood at our side. Though tasked with defending their people and city, they didn’t reject our help against a shared enemy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even as Cabal drop pods rained upon the city, Neomuna’s populace was nowhere to be found. Its citizens had prepared for war, retreating into the Cloud Ark — a simulated reality created through the Neomuni connection to the Veil. The Cloud Ark was also a great power source for the city, shielding them from Vex incursions for years of isolation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But Neomuna’s splendor had been tainted. A large portion of the city had been crushed by the arrival of Calus’s vessel, the Typhon Imperator. With it, the Shadow Legion arrived in force, accompanied by some of the Witness’s personal troops — later known to us as the Dread. Among them strode great hulking abominations called Tormentors, capable of going toe-to-toe with Lightbearers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris’s drop pod had landed nearby, and he needed us to help free him. He no longer possessed his paracausal Light and lacked the strength he once had, though his determination remained unbroken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before freeing him, our Ghost noticed an unknown energy — paracausal in nature — a mysterious verdant source of power. It appeared as threads, and when we reached out, darkness overtook us. Yet this wasn’t corruption or malice; it was the energy of potential, fate, purpose, and connection. We had found the signature of the Darkness emanating from the Veil — a new element at our command.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the first time, we discovered Strand — the power of the Darkness, distinct from what the Witness had shown through Stasis. Many individuals across the war had used Darkness, but to our knowledge, we were the first to wield Strand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our temporary surge of power allowed us to annihilate a large contingent of Shadow Legion troops, but pushing ourselves too far left us exhausted. We collapsed, and Osiris had to be saved by the Cloud Striders, who dispatched a Tormentor and several Cabal with ease.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After regrouping, we headed for the Veil’s containment building but found it overrun with Cabal. We also encountered tools the Witness and Calus had deployed — paracausal disruptors that prevented us from using Light and Dark powers. Pushing through by force alone, we reached the overlook to the containment building and saw it swarming with enemies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our Ghost was momentarily possessed again, allowing us to glimpse a communication between Calus and the Witness. Their plan was to link a device called the Radial Mast to the Veil — a relay meant to connect the Veil and the Traveler. Perhaps the Radial Mast was how the Witness intended to complete this link.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The device was aboard Calus’s flagship, the Typhon Imperator, and so our next move was clear: assault the ship and destroy the Mast before it could be used.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we reached the deepest chambers of the Typhon Imperator, Calus’s forces lay in wait, and his trap was sprung. The shields surrounding the Radial Mast were impenetrable. Even after regaining control of Strand, we couldn’t break through. Our Light was fading, and if not for Caiatl — who attacked the vessel in force — we would have perished.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our new Strand powers fascinated Osiris. He believed they originated from the Veil itself and were tactically valuable, being unaccounted for in the Witness’s plans. He pushed us to master this power, yet even as we assisted the Cloud Striders, control eluded us. Each time we reached deeper understanding, it slipped away.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Still, Strand gave us an advantage. Calus’s disruptors didn’t account for it and could be destroyed with it. Osiris’s research continued, revealing that unlike the Light — rooted in the physical universe — Darkness was based in the immaterial: emotion, thought, will, and fate. The Witness was not Darkness itself, but a wielder of it, and even Darkness was not evil, merely another cosmic force.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our lessons were soon interrupted. Calus’s forces were moving to bring the Radial Mast to the Veil. We had to intervene quickly. If linking the Veil could grant the Witness victory, we had to stop it. With Rohan at our side, we pushed forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our Strand powers grew stronger, allowing us to destroy Cabal commanders and even Tormentors. Yet when it came time to destroy the Radial Mast, our power failed us. Rohan made the ultimate sacrifice, destroying the Mast and securing victory at the cost of his life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was no time to grieve. We needed to master Strand, or Rohan’s death would be in vain. We realized our mistake: unlike Stasis, the element of control, Strand required surrender — to let go and accept one’s place in the Weave that binds all life. Through that understanding, we achieved mastery over Strand — just in time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus’s forces prepared to assault the Veil containment facility again, intending to let the Witness enact the Final Shape. Whether through the Mast or by taking the Veil itself, the result would be the same. With Caiatl and Nimbus at our side, we defended the facility as long as possible. Eventually, we were forced to retreat inside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus broke through the defenses in a rampage. Beneath the ancient darkness of the Veil, we faced the Emperor himself, wielding Strand empowered by the Veil. His power was immense, but in the end, he fell. It was his final battle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Caiatl joined us to mourn the man her father had once been, while Nimbus regrouped. Our Ghost began to feel strange, and Osiris’s warning came too late. The Witness possessed our Ghost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Ghosts are part of the Traveler — made from its same cosmic flesh. The Witness had needed the Radial Mast, a grand Light construct, to link the Veil and the Traveler. Now, by possessing our Ghost, it had another conduit of Light. We couldn’t bring ourselves to destroy our own companion. We failed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A stream of cosmic energy erupted from the Veil, striking the Traveler. Nimbus saved our Ghost, but it was too late.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the Helm, the Coalition leaders watched as the Witness enacted the next step of its plan — a moment millions of years in the making. The Witness approached the Traveler, outstretched its hand, and carved lines into its divine surface. The lines joined, and the space between folded inward. The Traveler was dissected, revealing a portal into its pale heart. The Witness and its Pyramid vessels entered, seeking to merge Light and Darkness within — to impose the Final Shape: a stagnant universe without change, ruled by the Witness alone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We stood before the portal and beheld our failure. It was over. We had lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the struggle wasn’t done. It would take time for the Witness to complete its plans, and while it worked within the Traveler, its forces still ravaged the system. On Neomuna, we worked with Nimbus to uncover more about the Veil and confirmed that the Heart of the Black Garden had been a failed copy of it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We recovered the lost Submind Soteria, who revealed that an enemy of the Witness resided on Titan — a key to saving existence itself. But Titan remained taken, lost to the Witness’s grasp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, Neomuna’s citizens began having nightmares — not ordinary ones. These dreams spoke with a cruel, mocking voice that laughed at suffering. Soon, we began hearing it too, even while awake. The voice grew louder when holding relics of Nezarec.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His whispers echoed through the Vex network and Neomuna’s plazas. The voice beckoned us, an invitation leading to Essence — the wreckage of the Witness’s Pyramid ship, struck by the Traveler’s Light. Within it, Light and Dark intertwined, birthing wild growths — a new Tree of Silver Wings whose roots pierced something vital: Nezarec’s interred remains.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After his dissection by the Fallen, the Witness had salvaged what remained of its Disciple, placing him in suspension aboard the vessel. Nezarec was dead, yet not dead enough to stop dreaming. His head was all that remained, yet like a seed, life began to regrow. The roots of the tree pierced his containment, feeding him Light. His body, a grotesque fusion of Light and Dark, began to reform.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we ventured through, we fed Light and Darkness to the roots to progress, each stage fueling Nezarec’s rebirth. His heartbeat thundered through the corridors, heralding doom. At the height of his resurgence, he confronted us — a monstrous abomination wielding Night Terror, seeking to devour our fear and unleash his wrath.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But we had mastered both Light and Darkness. We struck him down as we had Rhulk and Calus. With his dying breath, Nezarec vowed that his memory would never fade — that his voice would haunt our quietest moments. Whether he persists in psychic form remains uncertain, but given his return once before, we cannot dismiss the possibility.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back on Earth, remnants of the Shadow Legion continued their dark master’s work. The Witness’s hatred was boundless — its actions driven by cruelty, by a desire to make us feel the same helplessness it once knew. People were being kidnapped, herded into fortified prison camps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, Mara Sov intervened. Having seen our mastery of Light and Darkness, she deemed us worthy, naming us Queensguard — a new royal order. Alongside Devrim Kay, Amanda Holliday, Mithrax, and the Crow, we launched daring raids to free the captives of Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After several successful rescues, a trap was sprung. We received a warning from an unexpected source: Eramis. Her faith in the Witness had shattered. The suffering inflicted upon her people broke her spirit beyond repair. She no longer sought vengeance — she had seen enough of it. Turning from the Witness, she sought her long-lost mate, Athrys, but before departing, she warned us of the ambush ahead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We ignored her. She had always been our enemy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many of us escaped, but Amanda Holliday paid the price. Eramis saved Mithrax from the explosion, repaying his mercy from the relic hunts — but Amanda was gone. She gave her life so others could escape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her death shook us all. Crow was devastated — despite their complicated friendship, Amanda had come to see him as someone new, not Uldren reborn. Yet it was Zavala who suffered most.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He had watched the Traveler give its Light to the Hive, nearly abandon humanity, and stand idle as his loved ones died — his son, his wife, and now a dear friend who was like a daughter. Zavala’s faith broke.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He cursed the Traveler. If it would not lift a finger to save its people, then he would. Like Atlas, he would shoulder the burden of the coming war — the war for all life in the universe. A war that would begin beneath the methane seas of Titan, where a long-lost Leviathan would finally rise from the deep.
