                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the shadow of forgotten memories, a newly risen Guardian awakens in Old Russia and embarks on a journey from obscurity to legend. Guided by their Ghost, they battle the Fallen, uncover the Hive's dark rituals on the Moon, and confront the time-bending Vex across Venus and Mars. Their quest to save humanity leads them through ancient wars, cryptic allies, and godlike enemies, culminating in the destruction of the Black Garden’s corrupted heart and a fateful descent into the Vault of Glass—where time itself is their enemy. From the first spark of Light to the unraveling of cosmic threats, this is the Guardian's first great stand against the Darkness.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Our journey began, as journeys do for Guardians, in darkness—until… light. Not some great and glorious thing filled with triumph and fanfare, but a slow and steady thing, like the rousing of a great hero after a long and well-earned slumber. We awoke to the sights of Old Russia and the voice of our Ghost, and we realized that we knew nothing of our past.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When one of the worthy dead is chosen by a Ghost and risen as a Guardian of the Light, they remember nothing of their past lives. Some might get lucky, and they might have an object from their person that identifies who they were. It could be as simple as a name badge; it could be something as extensive as a journal for those who are lucky enough. But most of the time, Guardians are risen with no idea of who they were and no connection to their past lives. So it was for us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would have no conception of who we were and what we had done, or why we were in Old Russia—but it didn't matter. The Cosmodrome at Baikonur was a dangerous hunting ground, and immediately we were being pursued by a squadron of Fallen raiders. Our Ghost would search through the wreckage and ruins until they found what they were looking for—us. But they were now not the only ones taking the risk. We needed to escape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, narrowly evading the Fallen House of Devils, we found our way into the Wall and found an old jumpship. It had not been operated in hundreds of years, perhaps. It was rusty and in need of repair, but it would be enough to get us to the place we needed to go. It would take us to the place we would one day call home—The Last City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From atop the Wall, we took our first steps into the Tower, and we saw that we were surrounded by a company of many heroes. Maybe it was here that we quietly made a choice—to do good and to fight for these people. People we didn't know yet. People we had only just realized existed in this strange world on the brink of collapse again. If we made this decision in this moment, that was perhaps our first true unspoken act of heroism.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it would not be our last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After speaking with the Vanguard and listening to the Speaker, we knew our purpose. As a Guardian of the Light, we were bound to defend our home and our people, lest all of Sol should fall into ruin. The Speaker warned us of an imminent threat—that the Darkness was coming back, and that we would not survive at this time. We would need to push back the Darkness alongside other Guardians on Earth and beyond.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would not know the face of this evil for some time, and the Speaker would die before he learned the truth. But we would ride out to face this evil nonetheless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we went forth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We first returned to the Cosmodrome, where we acquired a jump drive for our ship from a Fallen Archon who had initially pursued us alongside the scouting team that found us. His name was Rixis, and with his defeat, the House of Devils had suffered its first major blow at our hands. We would also go on to defeat the High Servitor of the House of Devils, Sepiks Prime.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Across the Cosmodrome, we first encountered the Hive and their Wizards who came from the Moon. But it was our discovery of Rasputin's remaining systems that would be most valuable. Through both Fallen meddling and the reactivation of an ancient communications array that we had discovered in a portion of the old Warmind bunker system within Old Russia, a portion of Rasputin would be sent out to the rest of the system—a portion that one day would be reunited with the whole.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hive's presence was worth investigating further, and so we followed their trail to the place that Guardians had long feared: Luna. Touching down on the surface of the Moon, we were able to follow the signal of a Guardian who had ventured here. We followed their trail until we discovered a massive pair of doors and a looming Hive structure. Before these doors, the Guardian was found, and they were dead. Not even the Light remained.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before the doors of this temple to Oryx's son, Crota, we saw what was left of them and briefly turned around. There we saw our first glimpse of a stranger off in the distance, watching us from beyond. But we had but moments to observe this. The door in front of us began to unseal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Inside, the Hive would face us, and we would discover the Guardian's Ghost. This would also be the point at which we discovered the extent of the Hive's presence on the Moon. For centuries, they had been building up their forces and had been waiting to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We delved deeper into the Hive's secrets—stealing from the World's Grave, the archive of the Hive, and defeating the abominations they raised in their Summoning Pits. We shattered the remnants of Crota's sword to the darkest edge and defeated a Warden of Oryx's shrine on the Moon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The deepest parts of this infestation were remarkable, but the true malice of the Hive was unknown to us until the Speaker contacted us out of the blue. He stated that the Hive were engaged in a ritual to drain the Traveler of its Light, and so we rushed back to the Temple of Crota, where we had first descended into the Hellmouth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In that moment, we were contacted yet again by that mysterious stranger on the ridge. She sent us coordinates to a region of Venus known as the Ishtar Sink, which we would soon investigate. She promised us that if we were to defeat the Hive, there were greater threats still to the system out there.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We returned to our mission and descended into the Hive ritual chamber. There, we discovered what the Hive were experimenting on—a Shard of the Traveler itself. It was unclear how they were able to use this to manipulate the Traveler and drain its Light, but it did point to the idea that all Shards of the Traveler are somehow linked to it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After successfully freeing the Shard of the Traveler, we went on our mission to Venus, emboldened by our successes. We found ourselves cutting through the overgrown ruins of the Ishtar Academy. It was here that we first encountered another foe—the Vex, the time-traveling machines of unknown origin filled with millions of Radiolaria.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After defeating them, we met the Exo Stranger at last. To cut a long story shorter than was necessary, she informed us that the Traveler would not truly heal until we found the legendary Black Garden's heart and ripped it out. Our Ghost prompted us that the information we needed could only be found with the Awoken. They were the only ones who knew about the location of the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In possibly the most frustrating of turns, the Exo Stranger had little more to say to us. After all, she had no time to even explain why she didn't have time to explain. But we at least had a heading, and as she disappeared into nothingness, we resolved to go to the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But first, we would need to pay the Awoken a visit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so we went out to the territory of the Reef and were quickly picked up by the Awoken patrols. In our initial somewhat frosty reception with Prince Uldren and Queen Mara, we were told that if we recovered the eye of a Vex Gate Lord, they would forge us a key into the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite Uldren’s insistence that this was a fool’s errand, we began our search and returned to Venus. Along with discovering a Golden Age Ishtar Collective lab and defeating the Kell of the Fallen House of Winter, we were able to pinpoint a location where we would find a Vex Gate Lord—a place called the Endless Steps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we ventured there, we had to battle through many Vex frames to reach our target, Zydron. But even this powerful Vex Gate Lord, an Axis Mind in control of all the local Vex, was not enough to stop us. We struck it down and took what remained of it to the Queen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Uldren begrudgingly obliged and ripped out the relevant components from the eye of the Vex Gate Lord. Unfortunately, the component was broken and would need to be charged in order to allow us ingress into the Black Garden. Uldren gave us our less-than-functional prize, and at Mara’s request informed us that an entrance to the Black Garden could be found near Meridian Bay on Mars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Queen also demanded that we would one day return to repay her generosity. She had shown us mercy, given that we had barged into her kingdom, and she would allow us to leave—assuming that we returned when the time was right. But that would have to wait until another day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Martian sands were calling our name.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meridian Bay was a heavily contested zone when we arrived, filled with Cabal forces from the five scouting legions that had invaded Sol. Pushing through them, we first laid eyes on the gate to the Black Garden, in a place called the Valley of the Kings. Now all we needed to do was properly fix the Gate Lord’s eye.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we explored Mars for a way to do this, we carved deep into Vex territory, shutting down many of their portals that allowed them to exit from the Black Garden in great numbers. We also had to contend with the Cabal forces there, and dealt many serious blows to them, including taking out three of their Scion Flayers and even defeating the infamous Valus Ta’aurc, who was stationed on the Cabal land tank of the Cerberus Vae III.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside these great defeats, we also discovered something remarkable. We found Rasputin again—the same fragment of him that we had aided in the Cosmodrome. He was here as well, within the Warmind systems of Meridian Bay. He was starting to regrow in terms of strength. Soon, perhaps, he would be ready to fight once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, though, our Ghost would discover our true objective—a means of charging the Gate Lord’s eye. A massive Vex Spire deep in Cabal territory would be our in. This particular firebase, where the Spire was located, was controlled by elite Vex-clearing units of the Cabal Blind Legion, and their Primus didn’t take kindly to his territory being invaded. But we managed to defeat him and successfully interfaced the Gate Lord’s eye with the Spire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All that remained was to return to the Valley of the Kings and enter the Black Garden itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we approached the gate, Vex poured forth, and the gateway reacted to us. We defeated them and crossed over. We found ourselves in a strange place—a world of stone and brass and moss. Ancient Vex frames stood here, motionless, covered in the growth of the Garden. These were the Soul Divisive, the Vex that lay within the Black Garden itself. They had seen the divinity planted here by the Witness not long ago and had sought to bind themselves to it for their own survival.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That divinity would be what we faced at the Black Garden’s heart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unbeknownst to us at the time, this roiling, formless mass of Darkness was a copy of the Veil—a flawed copy that had begun to poison the Traveler with its imperfection. As we stepped forth, we saw the Vex frames doing as they did within the presence of this unknown divinity. They had decided that the greatest means by which they could survive was worship, and so they had reverently decided to enact the behavior of worship, bowing eternally to this new, fetid thing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We saw the Vex frames leaving this state of worship and reacting to us, and in their adoration, some of them were empowered by Darkness. Three great Vex Axis Minds, known as the Sol Progeny, were calcified into statues before this Black Heart—each of them representing the past, present, or future. They would all come to life one at a time, empowered by the Black Garden’s heart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But with its power attached to each of these Vex, the heart was weakened each time we struck one down. And when the last Mind fell, the heart began to collapse in on itself, in a great torrent of cascading energy. As the light from this moment overwhelmed our senses and blinded our eyes, the heart was destroyed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The destruction of the heart of the Black Garden would send echoes out across the universe, and would set in motion everything that followed. The Traveler’s Light would begin to return, and slowly it would start to heal itself at last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we returned to the City to celebrate our success, we were greeted one last time by the Exo Stranger. She gave us her weapon and reminded us that there were more foes that we would soon need to confront. Her words and whispers would send us forth, and we would pursue the rumors of the dark power that the Vex had sought to unleash from the Black Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A trail would lead us to the most infamous Vault of Glass.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The fireteam that had tried to raid the Vault before us was lost mostly to time. Little is known of the exact details of the assault of Pahanin, Praedyth, and Kabr, but we do know that their ill-fated attempt to destroy the Hezen Lords was unsuccessful.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What we found within the Vault was the remains of Kabr—the Aegis, the last vestige of his Light—and we would put it to great use, using it to break the unbreakable within the Vault. To assault this great stronghold, though, we would need to face Vex with true control over time itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The power of these Vex was ontological in nature. They would be able to cut the threads of the timelines themselves here within the Vault—a unique power vested in this place alone. To put it simply: if you were removed from the timeline here, it would be as if you never existed at all. To fail was not simply to die—it was to never have been in the first place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We faced down their great constructs, including the Templar, the Gorgons, and the greatest of them all: Atheon, Time’s Conflux. Defeating these Vex would undo their control of the Vault and leave it as an empty shell of what was.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our first great conquests were complete—but many more battles awaited us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The resurgence of the Light had drawn the attention of others—of those that lay on the Moon, of those with envious eyes and hungry, slathering jaws.
