                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>The Gardener and the Winnower, primordial forces representing the Light and Darkness, once existed in harmony in the Garden, creating and destroying life. A disagreement over the balance between chaos and control led to a cosmic conflict, resulting in the creation of the universe and the birth of powerful entities like the Vex. The Traveler, a source of Light, blessed an ancient precursor civilization, but when they tried to merge the Traveler’s power with the Darkness of the Veil, they were rejected. In their desperation, they turned to Darkness, creating the Witness, a malevolent entity that now seeks the Final Shape—a perfected, unchanging universe—through domination and the power of the Black Fleet.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> The beginning is, of course, where we should begin, but what truly happened at the beginning of our story is the subject of much debate. Legends and myths of old tell us of how there was a place before time and the universe, known as The Garden. Within this Garden, there stood a Tree of Silver Wings and vast meadows of potential and metaphor. Within the Grove, there were two figures. First, there was the Gardener, who during the long days would seed life in rapturous celebration. Throughout the Garden, this life would grow and bloom into many wild forms… until the fall of dusk. The Winnower came with a scything blade and cut away the chaff from the wheat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Gardener and the Winnower are rumored to have existed in this cycle for untold eons until the Gardener became dissatisfied with it, believing it to have grown repetitive and unremarkable. Across this game of existence that the Gardener and the Winnower played, a single repetitive pattern always emerged. It was always the winning play—a final shape that defined the form of victory. The Gardener insisted that there should be a new rule that allowed for new complexity to also find success. The Winnower disagreed, stating that from this idea unnecessary suffering would be born. From this disagreement, conflict brewed between the Gardener and the Winnower. Their conflict brought about the creation of the universe, and the Garden fell into ruin. The Gardener and the Winnower fought and brought down the Tree of Silver Wings and left its stump to smoke amid the meadows.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If rumors are to be believed, this conflict also brought about the escape of primal patterns that survived and took root in our universe with an aim of survival at all costs. These were known as the Vex, and though you might know them by their brass frames, they are actually the tiniest of molecular life built into a connected consensus—radiolarian structures creating grand designs. The story of the Gardener and the Winnower and their conflict was told to us through some of our first interactions with the Black Fleet. The great Pyramid Vessels of our most ancient enemy give us some of our only potential ideas about what occurred at the start of the universe. Whether this story is true or not is still debated to this day, but what is not debated is that the primal forces that the Gardener and the Winnower aligned with are very real.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Gardener seemingly was aligned with the Light, a power associated with the physical universe, creation, and chaos—matter, gravity, energy. The Winnower seemed to be aligned with the Darkness, which is associated with control and the domain of the mind—one’s will, dreams, and nightmares. These powers of the Light and the Dark are known to supersede the typical laws of the universe, bending and breaking those laws of physics and matter on the whims of those that use these powers of Light and Dark. They sidestep causality, and for these reasons, individuals who wield the Light and Dark are referred to as paracausal or acausal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We may not know whether the Light and Dark truly originated with the mythical Gardener and Winnower, but we do know that these powers are found in the universe in a pair of ancient presences, incomprehensible things, entities of a sort. They are the Traveler, which is a source of the Light, and the Veil, which is a source of the Darkness. When these two great constructs were created is unclear, but our story truly begins with their discovery by ancient unnamed people long ago. For the purposes of our story, I shall simply call them the precursors to all that would follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The precursors were once nomads who would wander across their homeworld to survive—that was until the day they discovered something buried in the wastes of their world. They discovered the Traveler. It blessed this precursor civilization with the bounty that it would provide to thousands of others before eventually reaching humanity. The nomadic precursors advanced their technology and society under the silent benevolence of the Traveler, but whilst it doted on them with many gifts, its silence meant that the precursors were left with little in the way of guidance. They had been given abundance, but no meaning or direction. Their search for meaning defined their entire society. All of them were seeking to understand how to bring about a perfect universe. Many factions would search for this simple idea and how it might be accomplished—they called it the Final Shape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After much time, the scholars of the precursor people discovered that the Traveler shared a connection to another great structure out in the deepest reaches of space. This was the Veil, and they rushed to claim it after they were made aware of its existence, realizing that once the Traveler presented the powers of the Light, the Veil presented the powers of something very different: Darkness. To the precursor people, this discovery was meant to change everything for the better. They knew much about the Light of the Traveler. They knew of the bounty it could bring, but they also knew that the Light bred chaos and destruction when untamed and unchecked. Through the Veil, they learned the power of Darkness and saw that through its ability to control, the merging of the two might create a degree of autonomy over the universe that had never before been conceived of. They aspired in that moment to control the chaos of the Traveler’s Light by strengthening its connection to the Veil and merging the two. If only they had succeeded, they might at last have forged the Final Shape that they had conceived of so long ago. But when they attempted to forge this connection, the Traveler rejected the link and abandoned the precursor people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What happened next must have been the most calamitous time within the precursor society. Terror and uncertainty must have spread through their minds; there must have been bitterness; there must have been hatred. But no matter what they felt, what happened next would bring the ruin that they had experienced to untold trillions across the stars. The precursor people, having been abandoned by the Light, turned to the powers of Darkness for salvation. Understand that the Light is not inherently good, and the Darkness is not inherently evil, but the precursors were fueled by hatred, and their desperation spoke for itself. Recovered records indicate that a group amongst them known as the Penitent struck down all others who dissented against their ways. They believed that they were meant to fix the universe and create the Final Shape, regardless of whether the universe consented or not. They used the powers within the Darkness to merge their consciousness together into a compound being of immense power. Their assimilation spelled an end to the precursor civilization and gave rise to a wretched thing born of a bottomless hatred of the Traveler. This entity would be known by a thousand names over a thousand worlds, all of them burned to nothingness over the course of its existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would one day come to know it as the Witness, and so it set out into the stars to pursue the Traveler. With it, the Witness took the vessels of the civilization that had brought about its creation, an armada of obsidian black Pyramid Vessels that represented destruction untold. Along with this Black Fleet, the Witness brought the Veil, pursuing the Traveler with the same intent as its precursor creators. The Witness would see the combination of Light and Darkness, and with it, a world without change, a world without chaos, would be brought about—an immutable, perfected Final Shape to the universe. And this time, unlike the precursors, the Witness would not seek the Final Shape out of a need for perfection alone; it would seek it out of a desire to subjugate the Traveler and all those that might oppose its will. But if it was to succeed, the Witness would need to gather adherents to its cause, disciples that would help pave the way for its purpose. That is what led to the rise of the first disciple, and they would not call him a conqueror or a mere tyrant; he was worse. He would be known as the Subjugator.
