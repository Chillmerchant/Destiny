                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Humanity ignored critical warnings preceding the catastrophic Collapse, despite clear signs from Titan and Mars. As the Black Fleet advanced relentlessly, devastating colonies and overpowering the Warmind Rasputin, the Traveler retreated to Earth. At the brink of defeat, betrayal within the Witness's ranks—by Savathûn, who stole the Veil—halted their plans. Ultimately, the Traveler sacrificed itself, scattering Ghosts to resurrect fallen humans as Guardians, thus granting humanity a fragile but enduring hope.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Though humanity had a few moments in which there were warning signs hinting at the nature of the coming Collapse—even some direct warnings themselves—they were often tragically ignored. Dismissed due to hubris or a simple disbelief that the Golden Age could ever end, these signs faded into obscurity. After all, it was easy to believe that humanity could not be toppled from the height of its power. But, like every civilization before it, topple we did—and this time, the entire system would be plunged into terrible darkness, like so many others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though the Collapse might have seemed sudden, it was not a single moment in time that turned the marvels of our Golden Age from splendor to ash. Warning signs existed long before, and the months over which the Collapse unfolded were brutal, marked by countless tragedies. But our warnings began on Titan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Proto-Worm God Ahsa, sole survivor of Fundament, had made her home in the viscous depths of Titan’s methane oceans. There she had remained, alone for eons, until the Traveler arrived and the Pacifica Arcology was founded on the ocean’s surface above. The sub-surface research team eventually found Ahsa, and she reached out to them with a harmonious psychic resonance. She wished for friendship—to break the loneliness she had endured for countless eons—but she also uttered dreadful warnings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The marine biologists who studied Ahsa heard those warnings and even brought them to their superiors. But alas, the ancient warning of the lone being who might have told them of the Witness fell on deaf ears. Thus, our first chance to avert complete disaster was lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Mars, there was another opportunity. A joint venture between the Clovis Bray Corporation and the Ishtar Collective had borne significant fruit and would be the next avenue by which we might have learned of the oncoming calamity and done something about it. By utilizing Vex technology discovered on Venus and in cooperation with Clovis Bray, a new AI was created. It was not as powerful as Rasputin, but it was still worthy of great respect. Her name was Soteria, though she was also known by another designation: the Augurmind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Vex technology at the heart of Soteria’s construction allowed her to be free of the Vex collective while retaining their remarkable computational and simulation abilities. In particular, the acquired Vex ability to simulate the future with uncanny degrees of accuracy was what Soteria had maintained. The Vex commonly used this power to chart a course to the end-state of the universe where they would be the only remaining form of life. Soteria used this technology to chart safe routes for colonial expeditions beyond even the reaches of the Milky Way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, the fabled Ishtar Collective leader known as Maya Sundaresh removed Soteria from suspension and asked her to run a few tests—namely, to chart safe courses for colonial ECHO pods heading from Sol to the Andromeda Galaxy. Soteria initially calculated over 300 preliminary routes. As she calculated those routes in real-time, her advanced algorithms recalculated: first down from 300 to 27, and then, moments later, to just 2. These real-time changes were due to the presence of unknown anomalous variables that presented a near 100% chance of total casualties on all colonial flights.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Soteria didn’t know it at the time, but she had just simulated and discovered the Black Fleet and had realized that it was on its way. Any potential colonial flights that might escape had a narrow window in which to do so, for the Fleet was getting closer to Sol with every second. Soteria forwarded this data to Rasputin on a private communications band and classified the threat under the subtext code of Rasputin’s own designation: Egyptian, a threat level used to define a force that defied all causal explanation but might represent an extinction-level threat Rasputin was always prepared to counter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rasputin agreed with the assessment and prepared for all-out war in the system. Soteria, for her part, was responsible for at least one attempt to save the lives of the human colonists who were prepared to go beyond Sol. She prepared emergency launches for the colonial ECHO pods at her disposal and attempted to send them out in a desperate gambit to avoid the oncoming storm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clovis Bray saw her actions and immediately reprimanded her, believing she had gone rogue. The ECHO pods were returned to their docking posts, and Soteria was confined to an AI pillory bunker on Mars—a prison for artificial intelligence originally intended for the Warmind Rasputin. This was a punishment for her defiance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a moment of desperation, Soteria attempted one last thing. She tried to create a submind, sending out a fragment of herself as data, reaching into space—a last-ditch effort to save herself and warn humanity. But it would be too little, too late. And even with Rasputin having been warned, there was nothing that could be done to stop the greatest catastrophe in human history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had been given two chances to heed the warnings of the oncoming Collapse. Through a combination of hubris, inaction, and misunderstanding, we had wasted them. And so, the Black Fleet arrived. So, the Collapse began. So, the Witness’s forces began to put Sol to the torch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first public alerts that something had gone wrong came from Rasputin. He sounded general evacuation orders across the outer colonies. Millions of people from Titan to Mars prepared to leave. On distant Exodus Program vessels, new orders were relayed to ship captains. They were to turn around and use their defensive systems as orbital artillery within Sol. These orders were briefly questioned, but most followed them. Not all, though. And even if all had complied, it would not have been enough.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The next sign came to be the most distressing of them all: the Traveler, which had only partially conducted the terraforming of Jupiter’s volcanic moon Io, was on the move once more. This was not unheard of. The Traveler would routinely move from planetoid to planetoid, terraforming them for humanity to colonize. But this time, its work was incomplete, and it wasn’t heading for a new patch of ground. It was heading directly for Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reason for this retreat was unknown to humanity at the time, but it was likely the same reason for the Traveler’s many retreats. The forces of Darkness had arrived. The broods of the Hive had arrived. The Black Fleet had arrived. The Witness’s forces were here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Its advance across Sol was a tide of death—in some ways, quite literally. While many colony ships that reached the outer system were wiped out almost universally by gravitational weapons from the Black Fleet, nowhere was the end more dramatic than on Titan. There, the Black Fleet artificially altered the moon’s gravity to create a 150-foot-high wave: a super-tsunami that spread out across Titan’s oceans and shattered the arcologies beneath a torrent of methane.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Warmind fought back against the Witness’s fleet, but even with all its power, there was nothing it could do. The vessels of the Black Fleet had technology and paracausal power beyond anything the Warmind could have prepared for—including fields that teleported weapons into a separate pocket dimension just before they could impact the vessel. Any rounds fired at a pyramid ship, even to this day, experience this same phenomenon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Warmind struggled and buckled against the Black Fleet and was seemingly left with little choice. In a moment of desperation, realizing there was only one way it could survive, Rasputin did the unthinkable: he disconnected himself from his planetary network and split himself into dozens of disparate fragments in hundreds of installations. In an act that he would live to regret more than any other, Rasputin abandoned humanity to their fate and chose to survive to fight another day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the forces of the Witness gathered, other interlopers made their moves. The exiled Hive prince Nokris and his Worm God patron Xol descended upon Sol and planned to claim the planet Mars for themselves. They arrived in Hellas Basin, where the Warmind’s core was located. In response, Rasputin could act. They were not the Black Fleet, and despite their immense power, Rasputin was able to respond. Against these interlopers, he deployed a defense system that flash-froze Nokris, Xol, and the entire brood of Hive that had followed them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This action not only created an artificial ice cap on Mars but also suspended the Warmind, Worm God, and Hive prince in stasis. None of them would be able to take part in the battles ahead. Only when the ice caps thawed hundreds of years later would this threat reemerge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the heart of the Collapse, humanity suffered without Rasputin. But even if he had died in their defense, it would have made no difference. Humanity died in untold billions. The forces of the Witness were unleashed upon the worlds of Sol. Survivors from the Black Armory recall moments of the great calamity on Earth, where the Witness’s forces cut down all who could not fight back, without mercy or remorse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Black Fleet destroyed all satellites above Earth’s low orbit in a titanic show of power. Then, a terrible great mist was released upon Earth’s surface, turning everything it touched to bone and dust. The Black Fleet was ascendant. Nothing could stop it as it moved slowly in, preparing to strike the Traveler above Earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Traveler was there, ready for the Witness and its disciples to claim. In this final moment, they would attempt to link the Veil and the Traveler and complete the Final Shape. On one of the vessels of the Black Fleet, a disciple of the Witness had been selected to lead the assault against Earth. His name was Nezarec, the so-called Final God of Pain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His dark influence had invaded the dreams of a few in Sol long before even the Traveler’s arrival, and now he had come to feed. The Veil was in his possession, and from his vessel, he would tear humanity asunder. For this one terrible moment, all must have seemed lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Humanity’s outer colonies lay in ruin. Its great defenders were dead. The escaping vessels were dashed against the Black Fleet and its forces. Yet in this moment, the most inexplicable turn of events took place—all thanks to one whom the Witness had deceived long ago: Savathûn, the Witch Queen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After splitting from the Taken King Oryx, the Witness took note of her cunning and viciousness. It planned for her to one day ascend to the rank of Disciple, superseding even her brother Oryx. This move sparked jealousy from Rhulk, the first Disciple. The Witness saw her as a potentially great asset.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps it was out of spite for Rhulk and his failures concerning the annihilation of the Ahslid. Or perhaps it was merely the most efficient use of resources. Whatever the case, Rhulk’s vessel was grounded within Savathûn’s Throne World, and he was instructed to train her to one day ascend into the Witness’s highest ranks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this moment of victory, she was so close to achieving that station. But Savathûn is cunning. She had no intention of following the doctrine of the Witness or completing the Final Shape. Perhaps it was her nature—predicated on lies and deception—that let her fit in so easily. Perhaps she had learned the truth of the God-Wave, or the lies told to the Hive. Perhaps she sought her own greater ascension.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whatever the case, Savathûn did as she had once done to Oryx when he was Auryx. With blade in hand, she fought Nezarec, betraying him and defeating him. It is not certain, but Savathûn may have used the power of the Veil to overcome Nezarec. Regardless, she struck him down. Above Earth, she stole the Veil—the key to the Witness’s plan—and allowed Nezarec’s pyramid vessel to crash into the surface of Luna.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this moment, a butcher of ten million worlds, a god of lies and deception, the next to ascend into the ranks of the Witness, had scuppered its plans and stolen its final victory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn took the Veil to Neptune, where the planet’s dense atmosphere, local Vex interference, and the Veil’s haywire signal were enough to hide it from the Witness. In orbit above one of the few remaining colony ships, Exodus Indigo carried Ishtar Collective researchers Maya Sundaresh and Chioma Esi away from the chaos.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They were assaulted by a Disciple, but miraculously repelled the attack with their ship’s defenses. The glaive of the Disciple that struck their vessel acted like an antenna, and remarkably, it picked up the remains of Soteria’s wayward submind. It was safely harbored within the vessel itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even as Exodus Indigo entered Neptune’s atmosphere, they would find the Veil. Thus, many years later, the hidden city of Neomuna would be born. But for the longest time, both the Veil and the city were cloaked from the universe, and none would know.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was assumed that Exodus Indigo had simply become another casualty of the Collapse. But in truth, their survival represented humanity’s one true hope. For here, the tide had turned. Humanity’s doom was still nearly certain, but without the Veil, the Witness could not enact its plan. It could not merge the Traveler’s Light with the Veil’s Darkness. It could not create the Final Shape.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The details of what happened next are as vague and mythical as the Traveler itself. Some believe the Warmind attempted to destroy the Traveler. Others believe that in a titanic battle, the forces of Darkness were defeated by the forces of Light. Stranger tales abound.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But what we do know is this: the Traveler sacrificed itself to save humanity. As it hung low above Earth, it was left broken. A massive shard of the mysterious sphere still remains, a remnant of that titanic struggle. It rests in what is now known as the European Dead Zone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The forces of the Witness were either banished from Sol or left. Seeing the Traveler’s sacrifice, the Black Fleet was ejected into deep space—or perhaps the Witness simply went dormant, waiting for another opportunity to return. But for now, the Traveler had won.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The cost, however, was staggering. Most of humanity lay dead or dying. The Warmind was nowhere to be found. Our great marvels, technology, and culture had been thrown into the fire. Our knowledge was lost. The ravages of apocalypse were upon us. Worst of all, the Traveler—which had given its last full measure of benevolence above Earth—was all but completely gone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ruin had come.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But from this tragedy, a new hope was born. In the moment of the Traveler’s sacrifice, thousands of tiny sparks of its divinity were released. Tiny autonomous drones, no larger than a clenched fist, spilled forth from the Traveler. This was the birth of the Ghosts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Their like had never been seen before. They would change the fate of humanity and all within the system. Their sacred mission—their singular task—was to head into the system, find those among the dead who were worthy of wielding the Traveler’s Light, and resurrect them as its undying warriors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though they were known as the Risen or Lightbearers in the early days, in the ages that followed, they would come to be heralded by another title: they would be known as the Guardians.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But theirs was not the only Light to emerge after the Collapse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the apex of the calamity, as darkness pressed in from all sides, another miraculous occurrence unfolded in the asteroid belt. Aboard one of the Exodus Program vessels—Exodus Green—the fate of another people was changed. It began with a clash of Light and Darkness, with a singularity, and with a young woman who would be the first to cross over.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though she did not yet know her destiny, she would one day be sovereign.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her mother in that moment would be starlight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And her father, the dark.
