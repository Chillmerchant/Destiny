                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>Rhulk, the first disciple of the Witness, helped enslave the Worm Gods on the gas giant Fundament and manipulated the Krill civilization into embracing the Sword Logic—a philosophy of power and destruction. After consuming the Worms' larvae, the Krill leaders Aurash, Sathona, and Xi Ro transformed into Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath, the Hive gods. Together, they waged war, annihilating the Ammonite and Leviathan on Fundament’s moons, and spread across the universe as fanatical servants of the Witness, relentlessly pursuing the Traveler and its Light.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> With his newfound purpose, Rhulk would slaughter countless civilizations in the name of the Witness, in the name of its great final purpose. The greatest conquest of the first disciple and his dark master would take place on a distant gas giant called Fundament, a world with 52 moons, whose gravity was so great that smaller planetoids had been pulled in by its force and collided with its surface, collapsing into its oceans and becoming great continents. It was on this world that the Witness and its first disciple would feverishly go about the busy work of sowing devastation once more. The Traveler had settled above Fundament amongst its moons and was uplifting a civilization there known as the Ammonite. The Witness foresaw that soon it would move to uplift another species on the world below, on Fundament itself—they were the Krill. All the while, there were even greater forms of life here: Leviathan creatures that dwelled within the oceans.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These Leviathans were the first of the Witness’s targets. It came to them and offered them powers nestled within Darkness. In those powers lay a truth and purpose so terrible that it would haunt the very shape of existence with its promises of death. The Witness offered them the Sword Logic, the truth that nothing has ever lived that will not one day die, and the attached premise that those who are strong enough to exist will go on existing by the right of the sword alone. But this was not mere philosophy; it was a practice that led to real power, curses, and magic wreathed in Darkness itself, derived from the Sword Logic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In time, the Leviathans would be twisted into new forms if they followed this dark power, but even before those who consumed these magics turned into the great ravenous Worms that we know of now, their people had been cleft in two, and war soon broke out. The war between the Leviathans and the traitors that would one day become the Worms was brutal and vicious. Fundament’s oceans rolled with blood as father fought mother, brother fought sister, son fought daughter. It was a rolling carnage that engulfed an entire people and left few survivors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One was a great creature known as Ahsa. She managed to escape her people’s fate by sinking into an Ascendant dream. Seemingly, this means that she used the Ascendant Plane to escape—a parallel reality to our own that mirrors it in a darker, more changeable form to those who have strong will. She would fall through the Ascendant dreams until she returned to the physical universe and landed in the oceans of a distant system called Sol. She carried with her the knowledge of who the Witness had been, what it had become, and what it intended for the universe. Her eyes were wide, and her gaze was long. She would spy the war across the stars and would understand the shape of fate and how it needed to progress if we were to stop the oncoming calamity. But the battle back on Fundament began to rage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the Worms were at their end, only a handful remained. A mother known as Xita and her five offspring: Yul, Xol, Ur, Eir, and Akka. They had embraced the way of the Sword Logic, as described by the Witness, and were imprisoned in the Deep. There, a Leviathan watched over them, holding them within Fundament’s crushing core. It isn’t clear if this creature who imprisoned them was of the same species as Ahsa or what the Worms had once been. It might well have been, and if so, it might well have been the last of the survivors of that great war, the last that rejected the Witness’s offer. We simply do not know, but what we do know is that its power was great enough to dominate the remaining Worms. It spanned the supposed size of continents and was known to all others simply as the Leviathan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the Worms’ numbers diminished, Rhulk and the Witness enacted the next stage of their plan: subjugation. Rhulk dove into the Deep and enlisted the Worms in servitude to the Witness’s plan. He effortlessly conquered the Leviathan, which addressed him and demanded that he stop. Rhulk responded by removing one of its ribs in a display of dominance. Descending deeper, he spoke to Xita, the mother of the Worms, and offered her a dark pact. The Witness had need of her power and her children’s power; it would offer her children’s sustenance and survival in exchange for loyalty. Having few other options and seeing the scope of Rhulk’s power, it was clear that this was no bargain; it was a demand, and so Xita accepted. Thus, as he took their mother to the surface as both a source of power and a captive, the newly anointed children of Xita—the so-called Worm Gods—named him the Subjugator.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rhulk took portions of the Worms that would form into their larvae, the small worms that we now know from killing so many Hive, and with them, he enacted the greatest of the Witness’s plans. He left one larva in Fundament’s oceans, ensuring that it would wash up and be found by a leader of one of the Krill nations—the next people that the Traveler was meant to uplift. The leader who discovered the worm larva was the king of the Osmium Dynasty, and this dead worm larva quickly became his familiar, whispering the Witness’s terrible lies to him—lies of an oncoming horrific calamity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The old Osmium King grew obsessed with this doom, which supposedly came in the form of a great God-Wave that would wipe away all things. He neglected everything else in pursuit of this truth, even neglecting his three children, whose now-dead names—Aurash, Sathona, and Xi Ro—would only be spoken in apocrypha. Their true ascendant names would one day go on to bring terror to the universe. Only the eldest sibling, Aurash, had his attention, and only when the two of them were studying the stars for proof of the approaching doom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Witness’s plans for these siblings were thus: the most cunning of them would acquire their father's larva upon his death. It would whisper to them of the same cataclysm written in the stars and would tell them that to find salvation for their people, they would need to descend into the Deep. These were the whispers told by the lying worm to Sathona—a simple lie, but one that would reshape the history of her people forever. All came to pass as the Witness planned, and in time the siblings dove down into the Deep.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There, Sathona’s older sibling, Aurash, stood with the deepest part of Fundament’s core and made a pact with the Worm Gods, Xita’s five children. If the Krill would consume their larvae, the Worms would provide them with power and immortality—immortality that they had long sought, an escape from their short lives, and the power to claim their revenge. In exchange, the siblings and any who consumed the larvae of the Worms would provide an eternal blood tithe and forever venerate the Worms as their gods. The Krill would have to commit acts of violence and devastation by following their nature. If they failed to do so, their worms would consume them, and they would perish.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The bargain was accepted, and thus Aurash, Sathona, and Xi Ro ceased to be; Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath were born. Together, these three siblings would stand with the power of Xita’s five Worm God children. They would be claimed by the Witness’s powers before the Traveler had a chance to uplift them; thus, the Traveler’s plans were subverted. Oryx, Savathûn, and Xivu Arath would go on to unite the Krill peoples, now believing in the Sword Logic of the Worms and in the promise of their own power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After cleansing the surface of Fundament, they would go on to scour its moons, destroying the Ammonite and butchering the Leviathan—all in the name of their newfound gods. A change came upon them, and they would no longer be known as the Krill. As their new purpose of being the winnowing blade was made clear, they would become known forevermore as the Hive. These would be some of the most fanatical servants of the Sword Logic. They would spread out across the universe, and beneath their blades, the Witness would see yet more worlds burn in pursuit of the Traveler. Though they would not necessarily know the Witness to be their true master, the Hive would serve their purposes nonetheless—tools, puppets, created by Rhulk. But the Hive are a tale unto themselves. In their long and storied history, kings, queens, and princes would rise and fall. Power would be gained, lost, and forsaken, but always at the heart of their machinations, there would be a link to each of the three new Hive gods: Oryx, the Navigator and King of Shapes; Savathûn, the Queen of Lies and Deception; and Xivu Arath, the Hive God of War. They would leave Fundament behind and look for new killing fields and killing logics.
