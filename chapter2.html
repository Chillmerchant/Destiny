                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the Traveler uplifted the people of Lubrae, it left their world divided and in chaos, with a harsh regime and tribal societies at odds. Born into this conflict, Rhulk grew up surrounded by violence and eventually became a brutal killer, driven by his father's betrayal. After a fateful fall into an abyss, Rhulk encountered the Witness, who granted him dark powers. Consumed by vengeance and hatred, Rhulk destroyed his entire planet and became the first disciple of the Witness, embarking on a path of destruction that would ultimately contribute to the Witness's pursuit of universal finality.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> After the Traveler had left the precursor people to their fate, it enacted a pattern that would follow for eons to come. It would move onward and find another civilization to uplift. This cycle has been repeated countless times, and as best we know it, in the Traveler’s wake, the Witness has always followed. Wherever the Traveler has found itself, eventually calamity and ruin would follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the course of its journey, the Traveler would arrive at a world orbiting a binary star called Lubrae. It had blessed the Lubraean people with the bounty of Light, and they would also grow and rise in much the same way as the precursor civilization had. The Lubraean civilization would be split in two by this action. There were those who lived beneath the Traveler, forming a harsh regime that would rule the planet. This regime would send out its killers, known as Stalkers, who hunted traditional tribal peoples and suppressed them. Those who lived free of this regime had to contend with the two harsh suns of Lubrae and with the terrifying foreigner that called the planet home. By the time the Traveler had left the Lubraean people, the division in their society became a wound that would never heal—a scar upon their people that governed their entire way of life, be they of the regime or of the tribes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savagery ruled this world, a savagery that would be its undoing, for it was into this world—and among these savage peoples—that Rhulk was born. Though he was originally born into the tribal nomadic society, Rhulk’s parents had come from the regime’s city. As Rhulk grew up, he saw how the regime’s sanctioned killers, the Stalkers, hunted those from the tribal peoples and seemingly spared none in their quest for blood. There was only one who was bloodier than the Stalkers, though, and that was his father, Rhelik. Born of the regime’s savagery, Rhelik would return the Stalkers’ malice to them and defended his newfound people by bathing in the Stalkers’ own bloody viscera as he tore them in two. But Rhelik’s family did not approve of such savagery, and eventually, they would be his moderating influence. He would be drawn away from such acts of gratuitous violence by the family that he had chosen. But for his son Rhulk, these actions were not the mark of a villain; they were simply what was necessary to survive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With his father’s example driving him, Rhulk developed a sadistic streak and followed his father’s footsteps into violence. By the time he had killed his first Stalker, Rhulk saw his father being carried away by a raiding band of the regime’s killers, and in his father’s name, he swore vengeance. He hunted the Stalkers through the darkened wastes of his homeworld, seeking vengeance for his father, Rhelik. He took a glaive from one of the Stalkers and called it Rheliksward. It was his objective: he would defend his father just like his father would have defended him. But by the time Rhulk discovered what had truly happened, his realization would change the name of the glaive, for his father’s betrayal was written upon the robes he wore. Rhelik now wore the colors of the regime and the Stalkers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rhulk was carried away by the Stalkers to the regime’s city. He would have died there, but his father spoke on his behalf and told the regime authorities that Rhulk would enroll in the Stalkers, for he was a mighty killer. Rhulk would do so because at least among the ranks of these killers, there was a degree of honesty despite his years of battling against them. The regime may have been harsh, but nobody lied about who they were—unlike his father. Thus, the glaive that he had stolen from a Stalker had its name changed from Rheliksward to Rheliksbane. Most importantly for Rhulk, he was able to freely enjoy the bloodlust that his father had sated long ago.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, his father left the city to search for the family that he had left behind. Rhelik intended to smuggle them into the city proper so that they might finally live in peace, but in order to reach the city, they would need to cross an abyss over a narrow bridge, a scar across all of Lubrae, much like their society had been cleft in two. On the other side of this narrow bridge, through the single choke point that they needed to pass, Rhulk was standing, and he intended to end his father. But curiously enough, Rhulk was momentarily swayed from violence. His mother and father apologized. They apologized for Rhulk’s exile when he had followed his father’s violence, for the poor example his father had set long ago, for the inaction he had taken, for not telling him more, for not explaining how the regime’s action could be seen as cruel, and why he had chosen to save his family now.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For but a moment, it seemed as though Rhulk’s family might find peace at last. Perhaps if things had proceeded differently, Rhulk might have also found peace and reconciliation alongside his family, and they might have lived out the days they had left in the city in some measure of harmony. But for one reason or another, Rhulk fell into the abyss. Did he fall of his own accord, was he pushed, did he trip, was something else there to pull him down? The circumstances are not clear, but what is clear is this: when Rhulk looked up at the faces of the family that he was slowly falling away from, he did not see sorrow, or heartbreak, or pain. As he fell, in their faces he realized something else was written. They were relieved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was the betrayal that would define Rhulk. It showed him the truth of the universe. It showed him that there was no place for weakness or the petty lies that held society together like his. Deep in the abyss, he would at last discover truth. How long Rhulk fell isn’t known, but when he did finally land in this dismal swamp at the base of the abyss, he was not alone. There were myriad creatures moving to consume his very body, broken as it was. But it was here as well that Rhulk beheld something else. For the first time, he laid eyes upon the Witness. It saw Rhulk for what he was: a thing of hatred, ready to bring ruin to those liars above. The Witness mended his body and his broken glaive. It empowered Rhulk with terrible Darkness and with an ability known only as the Witness’s Luster, something we still do not fully understand to this day. When Rhulk asked what he was meant to do, the only word the Witness uttered was ruin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With his newfound power in hand, and with a purpose granted to him in vengeance, Rhulk climbed the endless ravine of the abyss, clawing his way up out of Darkness until he beheld the surface once more. A confused son had fallen into the pit, but what had crawled out was no son at all; it was a monster, a new being of hate. Rhulk returned to the city of Lubrae and enacted his final judgment on his people. He first slew his parents, then the rest of his family. The city watched on in horror and saw Rhulk for what he was. But in his hands, Rhulk held a power greater than even the slaughter that he had enacted. He held the Witness’s Luster, and in the other hand, his glaive. Rhulk siphoned the energy from Lubrae’s own Sapphiric Sun and channeled it into the Witness’s gifts and his own glaive. He struck at the surface of his planet. The weapon had been twice renamed because of his father, and had been renamed once more in accordance with its new purpose—a purpose displayed with but this singular strike. It would be known as Lubrae’s Ruin, and beneath Rhulk’s blade, with the power of the Witness, the planet cracked. Rhulk destroyed his entire planet and shattered the suns of Lubrae.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeing the chaos that he had wrought, for a moment Rhulk was overwhelmed. Seeing the devastation, he fell into the ever-expanding abyss that had consumed his world, and he lost consciousness once more. When he awoke, there was no Lubrae, no regime, no city—only he remained, the last known survivor of his entire species. He beheld the Witness once more and saw the totality of all that had happened across his life. He begged and pleaded and wept and regretted. The lesson the Witness would show him, the lesson it was attempting to teach, was that these feelings were of no consequence—that all the life on Lubrae was of no consequence. They were of no consequence because they did not serve its goals—the Witness’s eternal purpose: the formation of finality, the end of the universe. In this context, no one that Rhulk had killed had mattered; only Rhulk mattered. Rhulk had long believed that his civilization was but lies, and so the lies of his civilization melted away. As he stood and foresaw his new place in the universe, Rhulk was asked by the Witness what he felt, and to this, as he took his glaive in one hand and the Witness’s Luster in the other, Rhulk said, “Relief.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was here that he became the first disciple of the Witness, the first of its messengers of doom that would faithfully destroy its foes. Though not all would serve for the same reasons, all would serve. Not as kings, not as gods, but as disciples—prophets, saviors serving existence. Whilst the many disciples of the Witness would conduct terrible campaigns of war and terror, Rhulk would be the first, and by most accounts, the most powerful. From his actions would spawn a legacy of bloodshed that would make the stars themselves tremble—a legacy that would begin with Lubrae’s destruction, and whose heights would be found upon a distant gaseous world, an ancient place with a rolling ocean beneath a depth of cloud. A world known as Fundament.
