                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the fall of the Undying Mind, Osiris’s experiments with the Sundial—a device that manipulates time—unwittingly draw the attention of the Red Legion’s Psion Flayers, who attempt to rewrite history and reclaim their lost war. Summoning the Guardians, Osiris leads the charge through fractured timelines to stop them, but his true motive is far more personal: to undo his greatest regret by rescuing Saint-14 from death. Through the corridors of time, the Guardians succeed, restoring the legendary Titan to life and altering destiny itself. Yet their triumph comes at a cost—new threats emerge, the Psions’ vengeance brews, and the corridors reveal a haunting truth: in saving Saint-14, the Guardians may have glimpsed their own inevitable fate.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> After the destruction of the final copy of the Undying Mind, Osiris noticed a distinct change in the Infinite Forest. All future Vex simulations began pointing to a single, distinct future possibility. Osiris explored this new world that repeated through every simulation and saw that it led to the destruction of the Last City — and to a monolithic structure looming over it in victory. He communicated this to Ikora and knew that a terrible threat would soon be upon them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But prior to this, Osiris had also been busy on Mercury, investigating other matters. He had constructed a device called the Sundial, a remarkable machine that allowed him to tap into the corridors of time — the passageways used by the Vex to travel through time. With the correct temporal coordinates, they could be used by us as well. Osiris knew exactly what he wanted to do: influence things to change one specific moment in the timeline, to ensure that his greatest error would no longer haunt him. He would try to bring back his long-lost love, Saint-14.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Saint-14’s death was his greatest regret. When Osiris first ventured into the seemingly endless corridors of time, he sent out his echoes in multitudes, scouting as far as he could. But no matter how far he went, he could not find Saint — not in the right moment where he could intercede and save him. After a long time of trying, he left the Sundial deactivated on Mercury and returned to his other work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, another force soon sought to make use of it. After their defeat, the Red Legion continued searching for technology and advantage within the system. Their leadership had fallen to a small group of Psion Flayers, who discovered the Sundial and saw that it sang with the potential to change the course of history. They decided to use it for themselves, dividing their efforts into the past, present, and future. Each of their senior trio pushed to control fate within one of these timelines, seeking to rewrite history so that the Red Legion had never lost the Red War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The three senior Flayers — Niruul, Tazaroc, and Ozletc — all ventured forth, leaving their youngest sister, Amtec, behind, as she was not yet ready to take on such a burden. Realizing his error, Osiris quickly recalled the Guardians and asked us to use the Sundial to venture into these different contained timelines so that we could destroy the Flayers within each one. Doing so would stop them from enacting their plan and rewriting history for their own gain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We faced countless copies of these three Psion Flayers, and in each timeline, we brought them to heel, destroying them for good. But the Sundial had not been made to chase Psions. Osiris had originally created it to recover Saint-14 — and when we brought the Perfect Paradox, Saint’s shotgun, into proximity with the Sundial, the two reacted. Perfect Paradox managed to transmit a pair of temporal coordinates to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris had previously blundered blindly through the corridors of time, but now, by following these coordinates, we could do so ourselves — and in doing so, we would find Saint.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following the first set of coordinates, we ventured into the corridors and found ourselves standing upon the shores of the verdant paradise that Mercury had once been. We immediately received a transmission from Saint-14, who had been sent in this time with his colonial expedition by the Speaker to reclaim Mercury — the garden world of humanity. He had unwittingly run into the Fallen House of Rain. They were tearing his people apart — the people Saint had sworn to protect. He was all that was left.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We rushed to his side, intervening and pushing back the Fallen forces. But Saint was broken in spirit, proclaiming that things seemed hopeless. After the battle, in a moment that had been foretold, we took the weapon we had recovered from Saint-14’s corpse — the Perfect Paradox, a shotgun we had remade in The Infinite Forge of the Caloris Lighthouse Spire — and gifted it to Saint. His spirit was immediately lifted by the power of the weapon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was even more encouraged by what our Ghost showed him next: a holographic display of the City as it existed in our time. It was not some meager camp beneath the Traveler, with a few barricades as walls, but a true, thriving place of life and safety.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we were pulled out, we quickly prepared to head to the second set of coordinates. At first, we saw changes in our timeline already beginning to take effect. We picked up a distress signal from Saint-14’s Ghost, Geppetto. When we went to recover it, it was surrounded by dead Vex and played an audio recording of the moment of Saint-14’s death. Time had already begun to shift.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Determined to prevent this tragedy, we followed the second set of coordinates. We landed near what would one day become the Tomb of Saint-14, located within the Infinite Forest. The Titan was still alive. There was still hope.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here, we had our chance to stop the construct that would have drained Saint-14’s Light — the being that would have left him dead for good. We faced off against Agioktis, even as it tried to capture Saint. Agioktis had been programmed to drain the Light of Saint-14 specifically, so when we fought the Martyr Mind, we stood on even footing. It tried desperately to contain us as a last gambit, but before it could destroy us, Saint broke free of his bonds and shattered the Martyr Mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He had survived. He had lived. And now, all the forces of the Infinite Forest would feel his wrath. The Vex had channeled all their energy and production into creating a singular mind to counter him — and they would not be able to recreate it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Saint thanked us for our assistance and stated that he would remain in the Infinite Forest, meeting us the long way around. He continued fighting the Vex in real time as we sped back to the present day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In front of one of the time-locked Vex Gates near the Mercury Lighthouse Sundial, Saint-14 strode forth once again — delivering yet more Vex to their graves as he finally emerged from the Infinite Forest. We had done it. Thanks to the Perfect Paradox and the Sundial, we had changed the course of history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had returned a legend. We had saved Saint-14.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His return to the Tower was a moment of awe and wonder. After much fanfare and celebration, Saint and Osiris finally shared a long-overdue reunion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The return of the legendary Titan did nothing to stop the Psions in their determination, however. With their control slipping, Tazaroc, Niruul, and Ozletc began a process of merging to create a far more powerful force that might oppose the Guardians and salvage their plan. The merging meant they would cease to exist, subsumed into this greater construct. Amtec was told that if their plan failed, she was to deliver their vengeance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus, the other three Flayers ceased to be, and their combined form, Inotam, was born.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But even their last desperate bid to stop us was not enough. The Flayers fell, and their control of the Sundial was completely lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Osiris moved quickly to plan the proper decommissioning of the Sundial, but not before we ventured once more into the corridors of time ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially, our explorations were blind endeavors. But by following the codes discerned from some of the obelisks Osiris had set up around the system, we made our way through the corridors to a deeper set of chambers. There, we found something remarkable — a time-lost vault.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At its heart lay a grave, but we could not yet reach its center. To do so, we needed to take a longer and far more complicated path through the corridors — one that took significant time to map. When we finally completed the pathway, we stood before the grave of a Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And as the words of Saint-14 echoed around us, we learned that this was not just any grave — it was our own.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had just glimpsed our own death, with all the uncertainty such a moment could bring. We had saved Saint-14 by venturing into the corridors of time — but had we doomed ourselves by doing so? To this day, we still don’t know.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Saint read aloud our many titles and accomplishments, we still did not know what had ended our lives. Perhaps we will find out when we venture into the Pale Heart of the Traveler — or perhaps not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But there would be many who would try between now and then. The first would be Amtec, who would attempt to take her vengeance on the Guardians in what might be described as the greatest assault on the City that never happened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amtec’s vengeance came from the sky — and it would require another god’s intervention to stop it.
