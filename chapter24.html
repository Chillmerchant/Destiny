                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After the Psions’ defeat at the Sundial, Amtec sought vengeance by turning the Almighty into a doomsday weapon set to annihilate the Last City and the Traveler. As Zavala and Ana Bray uncovered her plan, humanity’s survival came to rest on Rasputin—the Warmind once feared as a tyrant. Through Ana’s guidance, Rasputin faced his past sins, found redemption in the memory of his “son” Felwinter, and chose to defend humanity once more. With his Warsat arsenal, he destroyed the Almighty before impact, saving Earth and proving himself an ally of the Guardians. Yet even in victory, a greater darkness loomed—the Black Fleet, silently advancing toward Sol, heralding a new age of fear and reckoning.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> It would not take long after their defeat at the Sundial for the Psions to show just how dangerous they could truly be. Amtec might never have shown her face, but she would know ours. And she knew that, in order to defeat the Guardians, she would need to destroy the City and the Traveler. It was no good to just kill an individual when they could be resurrected. She would need to find a way of severing their powers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Cage was gone, Ghaul was defeated, and the Red Legion forces were mostly still scattered. But there was one asset that still lay in the system. It was her best bet for now: the Almighty. The Psion crews, along with their Cabal allies, decoupled the great space station from the direct orbit of the Sun, and soon it was on the move again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeing this as a direct threat, Zavala and Ana Bray both boarded the space station. Whilst they couldn’t stop its engines, they could determine its course. It was here that they saw Amtec’s simple and yet terrifying plan. It would be too late to stop the vessel now. Amtec’s crews had plotted the vessel’s trajectory—they planned to collide the Almighty with the Last City and the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was not merely the collision of a large space station with Earth. It would have been like a meteorite of significant enough size to cause an extinction-level event across the planet. Amtec would have her vengeance on humanity and upon the Guardians in a single decisive strike. This would perhaps be the most “Cabal” plan a Psion had ever come up with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But luckily for us, where the brilliant minds of the Psions would use brutality and rain death from above, we would answer with a god of our own. Ana Bray, as always, had a plan. She went to Rasputin—the one being within Sol capable of deploying the necessary orbital ordnance to stop the Almighty before it hit Earth at a significant impact velocity that could create an extinction-level event, and more importantly, to stop it from hitting the Last City and the Traveler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, there was a flurry of Warmind activity around the system. We deployed to his bunkers on the Moon, Io, and Earth with the intent of rearming the Warmind and preparing him for this great task.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the coming months, we would see the Warmind change significantly. It showed us not only that it was willing to learn from the errors of its past and from its own flaws, but that it had come to regret many things it had done—from the murder of the Iron Lords to the abandoning of humanity in the Golden Age. There was something in particular that had caused a serious degree of change: Felwinter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Felwinter, as it turned out, had always been the key. Because Felwinter was, of course, not merely just an Iron Lord, a Guardian, and an Exo—Felwinter had been a part of Rasputin. A spy in the Golden Age, an Exo-frame designated as a Siddhartha Golem, something which the Warmind would use to walk amongst the people and better understand them. When Felwinter had been resurrected by the Traveler, Rasputin saw it almost like a part of him being stolen and was struck with great jealousy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But long after he had struck his own son down with SIVA, Rasputin had suddenly realized the grief he was feeling—the regret of his actions. On the Moon, he made a makeshift tomb for his own son and even held a copy of his weapon interred there. From here, we would claim the infamous weapon known as Felwinter’s Lie, and we would see, at the very least, that the Warmind was beginning to grow. There was an echo of something more—something that Ana had helped nurture back in the Golden Age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To this same end of showing his regret, Rasputin would make an effort to approach Commander Zavala and make inroads with him. In order to gain his trust, Rasputin showed him a map of the oncoming threat and all the information that he had accumulated from his new Warsat network. From this, we realized that the Almighty wasn’t the only threat in space. The Black Fleet had been gathering on the edges of our system in silence. They were already here, and Rasputin had mapped out their movements. They would be in the inner reaches of the system within months.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When Zavala asked Rasputin why he was sharing this information, the answer was given in an audio recording. It was someone on Titan who had died at the beginning of the Collapse—someone that Rasputin had abandoned in a moment of need. Rasputin had lived to regret more than just the death of his son. He would not stand idly by and watch it happen again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This time, he would be the defender that Sol needed. He swore to stand side by side with the Guardians as an ally and an equal—and to give his life if necessary. And soon, Rasputin would have his moment to prove this to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had helped to launch the new Warsats, and soon Rasputin would position them around the Almighty. It brought down the great space station before it could hit the Last City. And as its ruins fell toward the nearby mountains, even though there was a titanic explosion, the Last City still stood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Tyrant was now humanity’s great defender once more. With allies like Rasputin, it seemed as though we were now at the height of our power once again. Humanity was back. Its great defender was back. But even now, we knew that the Black Fleet was approaching.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The great powers of the system were preparing for the approaching doom. They were not ready for it. When it arrived, it would return our worlds to a kind of darkness that they had not known since the Collapse. But the preparation that the great powers of the system made for this darkness did not begin with Rasputin alone. It would also begin with Osiris.
