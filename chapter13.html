                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>In the aftermath of our first great victory in the Black Garden, our triumph awakened a far older threat—Crota, son of Oryx. As his Hive forces mobilized across the Moon and Earth, a lone survivor, Eris Morn, returned from the depths of the Hellmouth to warn of the coming war. Scarred but unbroken, she guided us in striking Crota’s vanguard and halting his advance, leading to a final descent into his throne world. There, armed with vengeance and the Sword Logic, we destroyed Crota with his own blade. Yet even in victory, echoes stirred—Vex minds awakening, the Queen calling in a debt, and a far darker force soon to descend from beyond the stars.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> Even as we had struck down the heart of the Black Garden and attained our first great victory, our actions on the Moon had roused a slumbering giant.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crota, the son of Oryx, had seen the return of the Light's power and would begin to marshal his forces on the Moon and on Earth. This would be the prelude to what would become an invasion well over a century in the making. All of the forces that we had discovered on the Moon would soon be sent onward to invade Earth and to destroy the Last City.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But a remnant of Crota's past persisted still—a remnant that would be the bane of him and all his kin. For long ago, six of them went down into the pit, and now, ragged and scarred, but enlightened and determined, one would crawl out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris Morn. The last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She would quickly find a vessel and make her way back to the Last City, but her return was not the happy reunion that some might have hoped for. Her time in the Hellmouth had left her changed, and having lost her sight long ago and having had to replace it with the eyes of an Acolyte, she was seen as a terrible abomination—a thing of darkness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her Ghost, Brya, was gone. Her connection to the Light was severed, and now she wept an eternal veil of shadows, like blood drifting through droplets of rain. The Speaker and Commander Zavala wanted to immediately exile her. But Eris had been a member of Ikora Rey's organization known as the Hidden, the great order of spies and scouts that Ikora used to keep tabs on the system at large.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At her request, Eris Morn was allowed to remain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eris immediately sought us out and told us of the coming invasion of Crota. To counter it, we headed to the Cosmodrome first. Crota's disciples were making their landings there, and so we needed to blunt the offensive before it could truly begin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We went to kill Sardon, the Fist of Crota, and to prevent Omnigul, Crota's will, from corrupting the systems of the Warmind Rasputin that were found within Old Russia. The Seraphim bunkers beneath the surface were held, and the Hive were not able to use the Warmind's weapons against us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rebuking these assaults would leave Crota's immediate invasion plan halted. It broke the tip of his spear.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seizing on this momentum, we would return to the Moon and defeat the son of Oryx for the first time. We would discover Crota initially in the darkest ritual chamber of the Hellmouth—the Chamber of Night. But we would not face Crota as he had been in the Great Disaster. We would face a weakened fragment of his power.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Long ago, the Hive Knight of Xivu Arath had clashed with another Knight bearing tribute for Crota's father, Oryx, and—by extension, as part of that chain—Crota himself. Both Knights died, and their tithes never reached their overlords. In the case of Crota, who would have tithed this Knight's portion to Oryx, it meant that he believed he needed to retreat to regain his power in this crystalline form, so that he could safely be manifested again when he was stronger.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Trapped within this crystalline matrix, and unable to take true physical form without the intervention of his brood, Crota was vulnerable. And despite his still overwhelming power, we proved more than a match for him. We shattered his crystal, banishing him from this mortal plane.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His initial assaults on the Moon might have been stopped, but as one of the Ascendant Hive—as the son of Oryx, no less—Crota was uniquely positioned to survive death. He would only truly die if he was destroyed within his own throne world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks to the teachings of Toland the Shattered, Eris Morn knew this, and she asked us to assemble a team to do what she had tried many years ago—to do what the others had failed to. To end Crota once and for all, and to secure vengeance for Wei Ning, Eriana-3, Sai Mota, Omar Agah, Vell Tarlowe, and Toland the Shattered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once again, six of us went down into the pit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And this time, we would not crawl out. We would go deeper.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We fell at the heart of the Hellmouth. We fell into the Stills, where Eriana and Toland had once seen the light of Crota's Netherrealm for themselves. We battled through Crota's seemingly endless hordes to reach the Keyhole—the gateway that led into the Netherrealm of the son of Oryx.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other side, we were greeted with a green flame sky beneath the Oversoul Throne, and we would face Crota, the son of Oryx, one last time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though his might was remarkable and his strength boundless, we fought the Hive god with strength that he himself would muster—with the logic of the sword, the immutable rule of the universe that the Hive had learned so long ago: that only the strong shall live, and the weak will die.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And what's more—we would triumph.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We took Crota's own sword, the Darkest Edge, and plunged it into the son of Oryx's heart. In his final desperate moments, as his cries rang out across the night, the Sea of Screams shivered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When Crota's cry was ended—silence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But something out in the night had heard him. Soon, it would be upon us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But till that moment arrived, we would believe this to be our greatest victory. And the vengeance that would soon stalk us from across the stars would not arrive in the system for at least a few months more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And in this time, there were other concerns for us to deal with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were called back to the Black Garden to deal with a new Vex Axis Mind called the Undying Mind. It was attempting to return the heart of the Black Garden to life. Needless to say, we could not stand for such a thing—and so we shut it down for good.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the echoes of this mysterious construct would still persist in the infinite weave of time that was the Black Garden. Just like the other sol-divisive Vex, these Vex would bide their time until an opportunity presented itself once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And back in the system, there were other forces on the move. Strange happenings were occurring out in the asteroid belt, and soon the Queen would call on us for that favor we owed her.
