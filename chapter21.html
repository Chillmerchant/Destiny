                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>After Riven’s fall, the Tower entered a turbulent age where Guardians’ mistrust of the Vanguard drove uneasy alliances with Ada-1 of the Black Armory, the enigmatic Drifter, the outcast Eliksni captain Mithrax, and even the exiled Emperor Calus. Battles against Siviks and the Kell’s Scourge reclaimed Ada’s forges and forged bonds that earned us weapons of legend, while Gambit and dealings with the Nine revealed the Drifter’s dangerous flirtation with darkness. Mithrax’s mercy-born House of Light heralded the first hopeful ties between Eliksni and humanity, even as Eramis turned toward shadow. Meanwhile, Calus’s pursuit of Hive power through the Crown of Sorrow ended in Savathûn’s corruption of his champion Gahlran, forcing Guardians to rise again in triumph. Through these trials, we glimpsed both the peril of corruption and the promise of alliance, as whispers of greater darkness loomed on the horizon.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> In the aftermath of Riven's defeat, an age of lawlessness descended upon the Tower. Guardians had shown open resentment toward the Vanguard for refusing to send a full force to go after Uldren Sov. The fact that a rogue Guardian had achieved the version of justice most people wanted to see by taking things into their own hands only deepened the wound further.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was a time when we saw the authority of the Tower loosen to the point where we began forging strange alliances with many new faces. Of particular note were Ada-1 of the Black Armory, the former Emperor of the Cabal, Calus, and a mysterious man with no name who would ask that we simply call him the Drifter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our first real meeting was with Ada-1, and she very quickly made it clear that she was not exactly fond of Guardians. She ran what was left of the Black Armory, an institution that had been started back before the Collapse, which Ada had preserved in her time. Master Weapons Crafters, with some of the most powerful technology preserved from the Golden Age and improved over time, had endured under her care. She had seen the assaults of the Warlords in the Dark Ages, and had even seen the Black Armory suffer under those assaults. The Warlords had sought the remarkable weapons technology of the Foundry, technology that Ada-1 had managed to preserve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But now she needed assistance. Her forges were either lost or overrun, and the potent arms of the Black Armory had drawn wandering eyes. So, wearily, at the advice of the Spider, she extended her hand in cooperation to us, against all of her best instincts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst we would reclaim the forges from a number of assailants, none would be more persistent than Siviks, the leader of a new group of Fallen known as the Kell's Scourge. He was a ruthless opponent, who would first be known to us for his most daring gambit: a raid upon a Black Armory vault located within the Last City itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Given the Eliksni's propensity for taking technology and splicing it together with their own, they quickly used whatever they found within the vault to great effect. They augmented the armor, weapons, and shields of their soldiers. Worse still, they began to entrench their position, and even constructed the first iteration of a war machine that would go on to mar the system for years to come. They created Insurrection Prime, the first-ever pattern of Fallen Brig.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Guardians had to clear out the force of Fallen raiders from the Last City's Botza District, especially given the fact that the invaders had discovered superweapons capable of bringing devastation to the city at large. This was a desperate gambit by the Fallen, but it was an equally desperate defense by us Guardians. Luckily, we were able to fend off the Kell's Scourge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even after Insurrection Prime fell, though, it was clear that what was left of the Black Armory's stocks within the vault had been taken. Siviks was nowhere to be found, and there would be a trail of discarded and torn papers from the Black Armory's files. We discovered that his rummaging would lead us to other forges. In particular, notes had been found that would lead Siviks on a trail to the European Dead Zone, to the lost fourth forge of the Black Armory at their old EDZ facility.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This also contained a project that was unique to the Black Armory at the very end of the Golden Age, a project that was being created in the so-called Niobe Labs. Project Niobe itself would be an attempt to combine a forge with a working exo-mind from Clovis Bray — an exo-body. As it turned out, Ada-1 was the prototype.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After breaking through layers of security and finally facing off against the Kell's Scourge one last time, we discovered a critical component that Siviks had retrieved: Ada-1's lost Obsidian Accelerator. Returning it to Ada-1, along with the Black Armory papers and her forges to working order, meant that she would at least be able to trust the Guardians, seeing that despite the actions of the Warlords, we were not all cut from the same cloth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We earned her trust that day, and in the process, earned ourselves some of the most powerful and infamous weapons ever wielded by Guardians. The great Izanagi's Burden in particular was a weapon that still stands the test of time to this day. Much like so many others, it has slain gods in our hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Drifter was the next face to darken our door, although by this point we had already engaged with him several times, particularly in his so-called Gambit — an arena that pitted Guardians against Guardians in a race to manipulate darker powers and claim victory over the Taken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rumors and mystery had swirled around the Drifter for years. He had had dealings with the dark Guardians known as the Shadows of Yor. He had supposedly lived in the days of the Iron Lords and had made petitions of Felwinter himself. He had visited the so-called Fourth Tomb of Nezarec and lived to tell the tale. He had been to a dark world and seen umbral monsters devour his crew's Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless of which of these rumors were true, it was clear that this Lightbearer was dangerous. Our involvement with him deepened when we made our way into his ship and communed with the suppliers that would allow him to harness the Taken. As it turned out, these suppliers were the Nine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our interactions with them prior to this point had been very limited. Only the creature Xûr, who we'd seen occasionally in the Tower, had communicated with us. And of course, there had been our brief contact with the Emissary, who had invited us into Trials in the past — Trials specifically set forth by the Nine to see us in combat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This Emissary communed with us once more. She was mostly unknown to us, merely the Nine's mouthpiece, but they explained the nature of many beings as we interacted with them throughout the system. They also gave us the first true hints that there were some amongst our ranks who would begin to wield the powers of darkness, and that such darkness would represent an elemental balance of sorts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They had seen that Elsie Bray and Eris Morn would go on to wield the darkness, and they saw that all fates would converge on us. They also saw that the Drifter was beginning to wield darkness as well, in possibly the least surprising turn of fate. They didn't explicitly hint that we would be doing the same, but the possibility was left open.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the Nine, we learned that the Drifter had indeed been one of the so-called Shadows of Yor and had once gone by the moniker of Dredgen Hope. After the Nine had seen his capacity to wield darkness without corruption, they had gifted him the Haul — the massive orb at the tail end of his vessel, an engine of potential, and the source of his Taken when connected to the realms of the Nine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we communed more with them, we would continue to re-enter the Haul, which reshaped itself every time. When we did, we discovered more of their secrets, eventually culminating in the revelation that the Drifter was aware of an impending doom, and that he was preparing to survive a second Collapse of sorts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Nine had warned him of this incoming threat and had told him to keep playing the game of Gambit, leaving him with one of his signature Jade Coins — this time not embossed with the sigil of a familiar enemy, but instead with a vessel of the Black Fleet. Yet another warning that they would soon be upon us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Drifter's mystery was a curiosity to us all, but it was also a potential threat to the general safety of the Tower in the eyes of others. There were some who believed that the Drifter represented a greater existential threat than even figures such as Oryx. For he was not simply a representation of fear and darkness; he was a representation of potential temptation and corruption.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In particular, there were Guardians who, given the choice, would have seen the Drifter killed. Among their ranks was a member of the Praxic Order known as Aunor Mahal, a Hidden agent. She would take time to investigate the Drifter and find out whether he was working for good or not. In the end, Aunor chose not to strike him down, even though she easily could have, given the chance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He gave her valid information on the whereabouts of some loose Shadow of Yor pretenders, and with this, she was satisfied that the Drifter could at least be trusted to discern who was too dangerous to be allowed to thrive. The Drifter was safe for now, though it would still be correct to say that the Vanguard tolerated his presence rather than welcoming him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this time, we also made contact with another mysterious figure — an Eliksni Captain called Mithrax. We had met him before on Titan, where he had continuously given us the slip in a battle for a methane reactor at the station's core. We spared his life in a moment of mercy when fighting against a Hive Knight. This gesture of mercy that he had capitalized on was something that had utterly changed him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After dwelling on it for some time, Mithrax had decided on a course of action that would mark him as a unique member of the Eliksni — one with determination and grit, and above all, faith. He believed that he could be the Kell of a new house of Eliksni, one that stood in allegiance to the Guardians and stood for the will of the Great Machine. He named it the House of Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But his fledgling house would need time to grow, and in the meantime he needed to show his loyalty. And so it was that through a convoluted list of messages and alerts, he was able to bring us to the Farm, where he then told us of another invasion of the Last City that would occur soon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not an all-out invasion and an attempt to rob a larger vault of the Black Armory this time. No, instead it would be a more covert operation conducted by a Fallen Baron who had escaped the Prison of Elders — Eramis the Ship Stealer. She was planning an audacious heist: a raid on the old Tower's deeper vaults that were held by the Cryptarchy. If she succeeded, she would make off with the remnants of Outbreak Prime, the SIVA weapon that had first emerged during the SIVA Crisis.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mithrax offered us aid and became the first notable example of cooperation between the Eliksni and humanity that wasn't explicitly made under pirate schemes. As we succeeded, it would also be the decisive moment that would drive Eramis closer to the side of darkness. She would curse Mithrax and the Great Machine, and she would seek power elsewhere. The old dogma of the Eliksni was not enough. She would seek a paracausal boon. She would seek darkness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Later that same year, we would leave behind Eliksni activity, the Drifter's games, and Ada-1’s forges so that we could return to a place of opulence that had been pulled into squalor. The Emperor Calus had called us back to the Leviathan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had already made several return journeys at the behest of the Emperor. The vessel had been dealing with various issues over the last year. At one point it had consumed Nessus' planetary core, and at another point the last flailing leader of the Red Legion, Val Ca’uor, had invaded its upper spire in an attempt to wrest control of the vessel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This time, Calus had made a grave miscalculation of an entirely different nature. He was looking to expand his armies and to gain control over the Hive. He believed that he had to gain control over them in order to prepare the universe for the ending that he had foreseen and which he imagined when he first beheld the Witness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, he went to one of the Cabal's Athenaeum worlds and retrieved a Hive artifact of remarkable power: the Crown of Sorrow. The wearer of this Hive crown could supposedly gain a remarkable degree of control over the Hive and thus could be their leader.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus wasn't foolish enough to wear the crown himself, but he did create a genetically enhanced warrior to wear it. The warrior's name was Gahlran, and he had been enhanced with a series of more resilient mental barriers and protections in an attempt to resist the corruption of the crown. But the true power within this crown was wielded by one who was more deadly than we could possibly have anticipated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The crown's true master was Savathûn. Realistically, there was very little that could have been done to protect Gahlran from such corruption. When he wore the crown, almost instantly Savathûn took control of him, and the lawless Hive that had filled the lower decks of the Leviathan as nothing more than fodder or perhaps an entertaining amusement for Calus suddenly turned into an organized force.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This area of the Menagerie was known to house many exotic beasts, and in the process some of the Vex that Calus had stored here were released as well. But as the Hive were the more pressing threat, we were asked to deal with them and were dispatched to deal with Gahlran first. Calus called upon us, promising us untold riches should we succeed — and succeed we did.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These actions would be so impressive to him that he would begin to see our place within his ranks evolve into something more. In time, he would offer us a place amongst his Shadows, his secret agents that served as assassins and loyal protectors. The same agents that had gone after the conspirators, the same agents that had tried continually to kill his daughter, Ghaul, and the Consul. Some Guardians might have accepted the title. For a time, we might have as well. But the Emperor's sway would be held more strongly over some Guardians than others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Calus lavished us all with gifts, including donating a tribute hall of sorts to us — one that could be used to mark our various achievements. This tribute hall was fascinating, for it was haunted by an all-too-familiar spirit: Toland the Shattered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had interacted with his incorporeal spirit countless times by now. We first saw him on the Dreadnaught as he guided us toward Oryx, the Taken King, and we had met him again in the Dreaming City as he helped us navigate the Ascendant Realms. Now we met him here and followed his teachings to reforge a weapon of staggering power: the Bad Juju.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A hungry engine of the sword logic that Toland himself had conceived of, the Bad Juju was a weapon whose hunger was seemingly unending and whose purpose was to consume until the universe was made sharp. Toland used this opportunity to warn us, after we had acquired the weapon, that there were greater forces of darkness we had yet to face — forces that were higher on the rungs of the Pyramid than even those Hive Gods we had slain thus far — and that those forces would arrive sooner than we expected.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His words could not have been more prophetic, considering what happened next.
