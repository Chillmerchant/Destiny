                <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <p>The Red War began with a devastating surprise attack on the Last City, as Dominus Ghaul and the Red Legion severed Guardians from the Light and plunged humanity into its darkest hour. Stripped of power, the protagonist fled through ruined landscapes, guided by visions and a mysterious hawk, until they reignited the Light at a shard of the Traveler. Reuniting the Vanguard and uncovering the Legion’s apocalyptic plan to destroy the Sun with the Almighty, they led a bold counteroffensive. In a climactic battle, they faced a Light-infused Ghaul and witnessed the Traveler’s reawakening—an eruption of power that not only saved Earth but signaled a coming storm, as ancient threats stirred and Emperor Calus issued a cryptic invitation that hinted at a far greater darkness looming beyond the stars.</p>

                <h2>Full Chapter Text</h2>
                <p> There were some warning signs of Ghaul's approach, but we were blind to them. And so the Red War began with a swift, all-out assault on the Last City. The walls that had held back the Fallen for a hundred years were shattered in mere moments. The Cabal fleet left the Tower in ruin and rained drop pods on our home from above.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the head of their fleet, a massive, looming vessel began to unfold and made its way toward the Traveler, unfurling into a truly massive structure. We would not know its purpose at the time, but all too soon we would see that it would spell our doom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We returned to the Tower from the wilds after coming back from a patrol and saw the devastation firsthand. Our vaults were destroyed, our home was crippled, and in the opening moments of the war, the Cabal had captured the Speaker.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After pushing through the Tower, we rendezvoused with the Vanguard and Amanda Holliday, who shepherded us up to the Cabal command carrier. We were able to disable it briefly, but as we fled to the top deck, we saw that we were too late. The vessel had attached to the side of the Traveler, and as we wondered at its purpose, we saw him—Dominus Ghaul, the Ghost Primus of the Red Legion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He told us to behold our future, and the cage activated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were cut off from our Light. Our Ghost fell to our side, motionless. Our powers were gone. Ghaul proclaimed our weakness and our unworthiness before kicking us from his command ship. Our drained Ghost fell with us, down into the ruins of the Last City that we had failed to protect. We fell into unconsciousness, and all seemed lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But out of the darkness, a faint light flickered.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We saw a vision of a silver hawk in flight. We saw visions of new weapons, of Light, and new challenges that we might face. The vision ended with a view of a shard of the Traveler, in a place we had never been to. A place we would know, one day, as the European Dead Zone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then we awoke, lightless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We struggled to our feet. We were in the ruins of a city canal, and thus far we had been able to evade the Cabal. We found our Ghost, and we had to choose the only option that was available to us. We could not face the Cabal in this state. And so we fled.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For weeks, we trekked across mountains and through valleys. We passed the bodies of our fallen comrades. And eventually, we saw a familiar sight—a hawk, just like the one from the visions. We followed it, through mountains and passes, until at last, we collapsed from exhaustion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we next awoke, a woman was bringing us to our feet. The hawk was hers. Her name was Suraya Hawthorne, and she lived out here in the wilds. She escorted us to a safe haven in the Dead Zone, called the Farm. And there we reunited with another familiar face—Tyra Karn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She instructed us to follow our vision with caution, as the area around the Shard of the Traveler had been converted into a dark forest by the wayward Light of the Shard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following our only hope, we pushed through Fallen marauders and held close to our Ghost. As we reached the luminous Shard, our Ghost felt the Traveler's presence once more and was filled with Light. In a cascading array of returning power, we felt our strength build once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were not empowered in the same way as we had been. But once again, we were blessed with immortality, and we could wield the Light as a weapon once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our newfound powers would represent a turning point in the Red War.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were the only Guardian in existence to have recovered our Light, but we had to make the most of it. We were the last trick up the sleeve of all the Guardians in the Last City, and so we needed to get to work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After clearing up Hawthorne's communications, we picked up a transmission from Zavala, commanding all remaining Guardian forces to rally on Titan. When we ventured there, we found the remnants of the Tower's military in disarray. The Arcologies were infested with Hive, and we would have to secure the platforms before we could properly reunite with Zavala.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After doing so, we would be able to take our first steps against the Cabal. The forces on Titan had intercepted a multitude of Red Legion transmissions. Using one of the Golden Age CPU cores from within the Arcology, we would be able to decode those transmissions and discern the best way to strike back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was also there that we discovered one of the deepest recesses in the lower decks of the Arcology, just as we acquired the CPU core. We stopped and saw a giant looming shadow just outside of the observation deck. It was something magnificently large in Titan's oceans, a leviathan the likes of which we had never seen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was technically the first time we had seen Ahsa, the proto-Hive worm god that had escaped the Witness and Fundament. Though we didn't know it at the time, we were beholding one of the greatest signs of hope that we would ever lay our eyes upon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We didn't have time to marvel at her passing, though. We had to escape with the core.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, the secrets it decoded left little good news.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Along with the cage, the Red Legion had brought another massive construct with their fleet—a space station known as the Almighty. This station was capable of devouring planets, but it did so for an even more destructive purpose. Using its core weapon system, the Almighty could be used to cause a star to prematurely go supernova.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even if the Cabal lost, they could destroy all of Sol and wipe humanity from the face of existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even with this dire news, Zavala's resolve wasn't broken. He sought to reunite his fireteam and to take back the Last City no matter the cost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So our next objective was clear. We had to go and find the other fireteam members of the Vanguard, which meant going after Cayde-6.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fortuitously, with the CPU in hand, we were able to intercept various other signals from around the system. And one of them would be a signal from Cayde's Ghost, Sundance. That signal drew us to a planetoid called Nessus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here we discovered that Cayde had been tangled in some Vex technology that he didn't completely understand. There was also a colony ship that had crashed here—the Exodus Black—one of the Exodus Program vessels from so long ago. Its crew were all dead, save for the onboard AI, Failsafe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks to Failsafe's assistance, we were able to save Cayde, and we discovered that the technology he was attempting to lift from the Vex was a teleporter. Short range, but still capable of being used within the Last City to get close enough to assassinate Dominus Ghaul.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That was Cayde's plan, at least. But to execute it, we'd need to be able to truly reunite the Vanguard, and Cayde would not be doing this alone. So we had to go and find Ikora.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cayde told us that she almost certainly made her way out to Io, a sacred place for Warlocks, as it was the last place the Traveler had touched before the Collapse began.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we met Ikora, we also found the Red Legion, and we quickly discerned their purpose. At the cradle where the Traveler had set down, they were trying to drain the Light from Io—Light which bloomed from the planet's core in a latent fashion in the wake of the Traveler. The Red Legion were draining all of it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had to prevent the Red Legion's sacrilege, and in the process, we also discerned their plans. They weren't just draining the Light so that they could prevent us from having it—they were trying to take the Light for themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Taken population on Io also converged on the Red Legion's experiments. Amongst their number, observing the Cabal and the Guardians alike, were a few envoys of yet another dark figure in the background.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Savathûn, the Witch Queen, showed her hand for the first time on Io. Her forces marshaled and kept a watchful eye on us as we did what our work demanded—though we wouldn't know the Witch Queen's purpose until far later.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Suffice to say, her observations of the Cabal and the Guardians fighting over Light now make a lot more sense.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ikora was starting to formulate a plan, even though she had only been back with our fireteam for a brief amount of time. We realized that in order to discover more about the Almighty, we would need to leverage one of the oldest assets in the system—a Warmind bunker that was still active on Io. We would be able to use its systems to scan the Almighty for a weakness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From here, we determined that we couldn't simply destroy the Almighty, as it would take the Sun with it. Instead, we would need to board the station and sabotage its main weapon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this knowledge in hand, we reunited the members of the Vanguard at the Farm, back in the EDZ. The plan would be to engage the Red Legion in a two-pronged assault. The Vanguard would initiate an attack on the Last City and focus on getting the Vex teleporter as close to Ghaul as possible. Once we had disabled the Almighty, we would rendezvous with them and use the teleporter to get close enough to assassinate Ghaul ourselves. It was a risky plan, but it was our only realistic hope.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But in order to board the Almighty, we would need to commandeer a command vessel from the Cabal, and there was realistically only one option. We needed to steal the personal shuttle of one of Ghaul's Chosen—a warrior known as Thumos the Unbroken. We dislodged him from his personal command carrier, the Orobas Vectura in the EDZ, and proved that his name was, in fact, not well-earned.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just as quickly, the plan had to be initiated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We boarded Thumos’s ship and made our way to the Almighty. It was already in the process of charging and was consuming the planet Mercury for fuel. We fought our way to its core, disabled it, and allowed the assault on the Last City to begin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But all this time, as we had been gathering our allies and fleeing to find our Light once more, Ghaul had also been planning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His capture of the Speaker, our leader at the beginning of the war, meant that he had an extensive amount of time to interrogate him about the nature of the Light. Ghaul made his desire clear—to be chosen by the Traveler. And even though the Speaker had pushed back against him, his resolve was starting to break.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Consul, the other member of the Midnight Coup who had led the overthrow of Emperor Calus, had also been with the Red Legion and was counseling Ghaul, stating that he did not need to be chosen by the Traveler—that he could do as the legendary Acrius had done and simply claim the Light by force.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This disagreement, as well as the Speaker’s admission that the Traveler wasn’t explicitly communicating with him, would lead to a moment of utter rage. The Consul would leave the Speaker dead, and in response to being called weak, Ghaul would kill the Consul—proclaiming that he would indeed take the Light for himself, no matter the cost or impediment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we returned to our home, the city's sky was ablaze with gunfire, and the Vanguard were under pressure. By the time we reached them across the city rooftops, they were all but spent. We used the Vex teleporter that Cayde had painstakingly set up and went forth to face Dominus Ghaul.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We found him aboard his command ship, and before the cage of the Traveler itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we approached, an inferno of dark, twisted Light was ahead of us, and Light had been siphoned into containers all along the command deck of the ship. Something terrible had happened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In front of the cage of the Traveler, we fought with Dominus Ghaul and realized that he had indeed harnessed the Light. He had infused himself with it—temporarily but powerfully—gaining a twisted measure of the Light’s own power. We faced a paracausal threat that day. We fought Ghaul as an equal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was one of the most powerful Cabal to ever exist—a razor of a thousand worlds and an annihilator of suns before he had even claimed the Light. But now he had our own powers. Now he, too, had become legend.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a battle of Light against Light, we proved the superior force.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We struck down the Dominus in spite of his rage and his belief that the Light should be his to wield. But as his body fell, the Light erupted from it, and Ghaul momentarily manifested in a godlike, towering form—a luminous being standing before the Traveler almost the same size as it. He addressed the Traveler, believing that he had indeed become a god.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But he was mistaken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As he proclaimed the dawning of a new age, something awoke within the Traveler. Power, boundless and pure. Whether through our actions or as a response to a divine challenge, the Traveler had awoken. It was alive once more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It shattered the bonds of its cage, casting off its shackles, and it immolated the false god that stood before it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a blinding explosion of Light that destroyed the foundations of the cage itself, Light erupted from the Traveler. It shattered the cage, freeing itself and proclaiming its return, triumphant as humanity’s protector. The Light that emerged from the Traveler would spread across the whole of the cosmos, starting at Earth and then spreading out over the planets of our solar system and beyond.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Light poured across the universe, as far as it could reach.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The results of this moment would take time to emerge. Many worlds in Sol would be changed. Many great beings would react to this moment where the Traveler had returned.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But worst of all, in the darkness out between galaxies, something else had begun to stir at the reaction of the Traveler’s reawakening. A presence once lost to time, banished from Sol at the end of the Collapse, was returning. The Black Fleet perceived the Light.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Witness, who had so long ago been cast out, began the long, slow march toward Sol.
                    <br>

                    The Traveler was reawakened, and now it would be able to have its final shape once more. No matter the cost, it would achieve its ultimate goal for the universe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was only a matter of time before the Black Fleet would return.

                    For now, in the aftermath of the Red War, seemingly there was peace yet again. The Red Legion were cast out of the City, but there were still many remnants out there in the wilds. But at the very least, the walls were secure. Our last Tower may have been destroyed, but the Guardians once again were the defenders of their city. And with the Traveler’s reawakening and the destruction of the cage, all the Guardians had their Light back once again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the defeat of Dominus Ghaul also prompted another actor at the edge of our system to make their move at last.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One day, we received a strange invitation. Gilded and covered in Cabal heraldry, it was a letter. A long letter. An entire treatise from someone known as Emperor Calus. The same deposed Emperor who had been removed from power by his daughter, Ghaul, and the Consul in the Midnight Coup.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was inviting us to his Leviathan—a vessel that would soon appear above Nessus—and he planned to reward us for defeating one of the foes that had deposed him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An invitation from the former Emperor had the Vanguard notably concerned, as did the following arrival of the huge world-eating vessel itself. As it began to consume Nessus, we made a move to board the Leviathan and began to fight through the many loyalists of Calus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, though, we realized this was not some grand garrison. This was more of a pleasure barge—a palace built in opulence for the purpose of entertainment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, we made our way through all of Calus’s games and found ourselves in a throne room. There, we did battle with the Emperor of the Cabal. Or at least, we thought we did.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The more we battled this Emperor, the more he began to break down—until it was very clear that we weren’t facing a real Cabal Emperor, but instead a robotic double of himself. A facsimile designed to render his true self protected.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we struck down the construct, it told us to take the riches we had earned and to grow fat from strength. He also told us of an impending cataclysm that loomed ahead of us—a black edge that he had seen at the forefront of the universe’s leading void. A fate which we should all prepare for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We had little time to think on Calus’s words, but they would be representative of the doom that was approaching us in the form of the Black Fleet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But before we could even begin to prepare for them, the wave of Light sent out by the Traveler was awakening terrible gods and ancient constructs across the system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of Sol was about to change forever—and it would start with the return of an old mentor to Ikora Rey. A fabled Warlock, lost deep within the Infinite Forest on Mercury.
